4,ARFO3869,1,"Hello. I thought I will never give a bad comment/grade on a game due to an awfull behavior of the editor of the game. But I've to. 
Cmon was aware that this game should be delivered in the stores before the delivery of the ks package. 
And this company hided it during the all campaign. 
After the closing of the ks period in an news they informed all the bakers about the 2 waves. And the extra shipping cost if you would like to receive the core game before your ks parcel.
In August instead of December. 
In the following news.. after I think many many furious comments... They proposed to refund the disappointed backers... A simple email to their support... But you must do it during a short period of time. I did it as I was furious to pay an extra shipping fees... I received a basic email answer... Many support requests... Please wait... 
So nearly... No answer. 
So to conclude I paid for a game that has a basic game play... Ok no problem for me, with nice figurines ok also, with many streach goals... Wahoo... At a level of price which is too high... 
They pushed me to pay much more than I would like and It was not possible to cancel my order as the ks period was over. 
The basic shipping fees were high for one wave but acceptable but not if you add the cost of the second delivery wave. And the parcel will be not very heavy. Cards and small figurines. 
It is very far of my gloomhaven box. 
The shipping costs represent more than 30% of the cost of my ks. This is too much. 
They will definitely earn money on the cost of the shipping paid by the backers. 

Again, the same game (core game) in my favorite store will be cheaper than my ks one. 
Again an editor uses ks mechanisms to make a lot of cash ... With the money of the backers 
Again an editor... cmon hides information. to sell a product. 

I'm fed up by these editors, cmon is not the only one which use marketing and communication to sell a basic game as it could be the best game of the world.
 
So no cmon' game in the future for me.
cmon an editor who is not honest.

51,Kolac,1,"The gameplay is very very very poor, it's a simple puzzle game of 3 signs. I have no problem with simple gameplays, but this is way too simple. 
You have  a 12-card deck during the whole game, so that means not big tactics also. 
The figures are cute and cool (I liked CMON figures in Arcadia series too), but unnecessary for this game type, they are just for raising the price and dazzling people to show how ""cool"" is this game. But it's not. If the game would be just a bit more complex or have more opportunities it could be a nice game. Looks like they just wanted a quick money under the Marvel brand."

53,krotznapopulov,N/A,"Kickstarter all-in pledge>

Seems like a fun, light game. Non-KS base game probably not worth it, but with enough heroes/stretch goals unlocked, variability will be fine.
The expansions bring interesting new mechanics, and there's lots of heroes and villains available for much variability.
The fact that each hero has a different spread of symbols mean great depth despite simple rules is quite possible."

55,L0cC0,1,"Infinity Pledge. Pay the first, get the game the last.

I guess they used the money from KS campaign to pay for the retail release in August 2020, and with the money they get with the retail, they will pay for the KS campaign that we will receive seven months later, in March 2021.

Of course I can get the core (only that) in August if I pay for shipping TWICE. Woah, THANK YOU.

Absolutely greedy movement that CMON hid from fans during the KS campaign.

My first and last KS with these bunch of scammers.

Never trust this company."
56,leberschnitzel,N/A,"Again a typical CMON stretch goal and add-on riddled Kickstarter. One of the most wanted story lines is of course exclusive to Kickstarter. And an optional buy in.
I can no longer support such a sales strategy, it's just too much psychological tricks and too disappointing for people that miss the Kickstarter."

Its a feather light version of sentinels mixed with thanos rising. I could not be more bored by this gameplay. Every card is 1 or 2 of the same 3 goddamn symbols .. is this a joke ? Maybe 2 or 3 cards have something special but its just more of the same 3 symbols ...
