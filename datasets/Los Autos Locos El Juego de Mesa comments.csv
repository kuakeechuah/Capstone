1,AetherTower,6,"Played with 6 players and felt one set of the player powers more advantageous and one other set of player powers disadvantageous. If those were balanced, this might be a 7 or 7.5"
2,AkioSix,2,"Played a demo. Maybe a 5 or 6 years old child should enjoy a game, surely not an adult person. Very poor game design."
3,andretl57,10,just love it.

7,Big Bad Lex,N/A,"Not Played: As a first time around fan of the TV series as a child, I was beyond excited to see this was to be a game. Such an awesome theme with so much opportunity for each car to have it's own bonuses to thwart Dick Dastardly.. 

I have now read the rules and it seems the box is mainly storage for the excellent minis but they have forgotten to include a game. This seems to be a card flipping exercise devoid of any meaningful decisions. What a terribly wasted opportunity for anyone above the age of 6."
8,bigoi75,6,"really enjoy the minis but, after only one short game at Lucca Comics and Games 2018, I recognize it's a little too simple. Need to play it gain,"
9,Bonzenmann,10,"It's Wacky Races - so how can you not want to have it?
Very light but extremly fun Game!"
10,Broodstar,8,"Solitaire rating --- Has some potential.
Family rating ----- 100
Fantasy level ----- 0
Sci Fi level -------- 0

(I have to look into solo play. It has potential.)

This game does exactly what you expect of him: delivers a quick, light racing game full of fun moments and Whacky Races cartoons nostalgia.

• It plays quick. 
• Has amazing minis.
• The overall feeling is exactly as in the cartoons.
• The track cards and character boards could have been a little thicker, but overall they are ok."

12,cardonethemagician,7,Way fun party game!
13,Cat_O,9,"A good light game that captures the flavour of the show quite well.
The miniatures are outstanding.

26,garland410,8,"Surprised the rating isn't higher for this. I really like the mechanics and feel it emulates the IP rather well for a board game. It's fun, has cool minis, doesn't take a long time to play, and isn't hard to teach. What more do you want?"
27,Geekway,N/A,"Finefield, MM, 07-05-2019"

30,hackryder,N/A,"An overproduced box of miniatures in search of a game to play. Will be an insta-purchase for niche nostalgics but with zero interesting gameplay included with these admittedly cool-looking race cars. 

Card play determines movement - reminiscent of Odin's Ravens - but less elegant. Games with less than 6 require neutral cars and auto movement (one space each turn) as filler. Each race car/player has four special power cards. Dick Dastardly isn't a playable car; instead if he takes the lead he plants Trap cards in the path of the other players. 

All this supposedly takes 10-15 minutes, which sounds off - with building the track and moment-to-moment card play (1, 2, or 3 cards), plus special powers, plus neutral car movements, plus Dastardly movement, plus possible traps... it just seems fiddlier than it should be for a ""fast"" game, and anything longer than 15 minutes would overstay its welcome. 

This game with any other better racing game's base mechanics would probably be a hit. It's too bad this couldn't have been Downforce: Wacky Races."
31,holycrap2003,7.5,Okay.  The game has mini cards and the terrain markers are thin.  So what.  the minis are unbelievable.  I would rather have small cards and this track pieces than bland art at generic wood tokens. The game itself plays like the show.  It is fast and chaotic without a lot of long term planning.  The individual player powers are the only part a player has a lot of control over.  But that is okay.  This isn't meant to be Formula race 90.  Try to get your family to play that racing game.  It plays fast and leaves wanting to play it again.  Paid $37 for my copy at cool stuff inc so the price point is where it should be.
32,Hunszi,3,"Túlárazott társas, ahol közel nulla döntésed van a játék során. Sokkal jobb játékot is lehetett volna építeni erre a nagyszerű klasszikusra."
33,John Caliber,10,"The ideal game when time is short, patience is limited for learning new rules, and an upbeat, colourful and quick-fire experience is desired. The vehicle models are lovely and cast in pleasing shades."
34,Jonathan1990,10,My childhood favorite show. Game play is simple and tactical yet fun. The mean machine and traps mechanic is well implemented
35,Jopo43,7.5,Its a wacky game!!! A fun little game!
36,Karenv731,N/A,Played demo Gen Con 2018. Just want to buy the miniatures.
37,KarolusRex,9,"Very fun, easy, good for child and TV serie maniacs"
38,Kweevnidny,6.5,"Like a lot of people nostalgia was what prompted my purchase so I was a quite disappointed and felt conned when I opened the box to find I had bought a box of air I would say that well over 50% is air (with eyes on the environment when are they going to pass laws on unnecessary packaging) this could have been safely packaged and sold in something half the size, the next negative is the components the board is of thin card (not too dissimilar to Gibsons Turf Horse Racing track) and the cards are small sized (1 5/8"" x 2 1/2"") and fiddly to handle, I bought Tiny Towns at the same time it was £31-95 compared to Wacky Races at £35-95 and overall I was significantly more impressed with the components and packaging in Tiny Towns. The first positive was the miniatures which are excellent but I would expect that from a company that brought us Blood Rage, Zombicide, Massive Darkness etc. and call themselves CMON but I anticipate the other components to at least be industry standard NOT sub-standard. The last moan before I go on to the game-play is that the rulebook although easily read was a complete pain in the “proverbial” when trying to look up clarifications mid-game. So what about the game-play, yes it is luck driven that is certain and I understand the comments made by others but credit to the designer if you immerse yourself in this facet of the Hanna-Barbera universe the game reflects the TV show perfectly (certainly as I remember it) this game is for role-playing and having fun, it is all about the journey and having a laugh at yours or others misfortunes, it is not about tactics and clever plays although the special powers give you the illusion you can do that, by all means play to win but do not expect to do so, the game I feel will be at its best at the full player count of 6 and with gamers who are looking for fun, its no good placing Tiddly Winks in front of a bunch of Bridge players on Bridge night, some people have commented it’s a childrens game but I would say we are all kids at heart.
I would have rated this at 8 but disgusted with cardboard components in retail version and (imho) sinful over-packaging
(edited after first play)"
39,LucaCiglione,7,"Game is simple but it is able to take at table everybtype of players. Adiltscand childrens, pro and new player. Cars are amazing."
40,Luisjoey,6,"a good and quick race games, rulebook it´s not up to the explanation that could lead you to think it´s not made well, but it´s a great game!"
41,magedoc,8,"I got mine in the US. The cars are gorgeous, exceptional paint job. I have read through the book, but have not played yet. There were additional tiles in the box to replace the ones in the box with the missing information. I understand that this was a long overdue game, but I must say that i am impressed with the final product so far. The trays fit all the pieces and there is even a option of trays for sleeved or non-sleeved cards. I find the components and box to be from very good to exceptional (the painted cars). This game was made with love for the theme.

The gameplay is simple, but fun.  There is some variation in special skills among the different cars.  The games does play in accordance with the theme.  It also plays well solo.  There are some differences in a couple of the cars that would need a little tweaking to run solo, such as choosing from the deck when instructed to choose a card from another players hand.  This is easily fixed with a minor house rule.  The AI for the non-player cars seems to work well."

58,pauz666,7.5,Best in six. Remeber to move 00 car at the end of each player's turn. As the official rules say. This makes the game less linear and more funny.

62,Raf Richman,5.8,"Compré el juego por las miniaturas de los coches de una de las series favoritas de la infancia, no esperaba tampoco mucho más. Y en ese sentido el juego cumple, como nos tiene acostumbrados CMON. 
Sobre las reglas del juego en si, después de solo leer el reglamento, creo que el juego no alcanza el potencial que podría haber tenido, y eso fastidia. Parece un juego muy sencillo, enfocado a niños, pero no nos engañemos, este juego lo hemos comprado adultos por la nostalgia, con lo que un set de reglas familiares y otro para expertos se hubiera agradecido un montón, tal como lo venden me ha dejado muy frío, habrá que esperar a que la comunidad saque variantes a ver si mejora la cosa."
63,rexology,6.5,"Nothing groundbreaking here, but that shouldn't be what you are here for.  It is just silly races with nostalgia factor for those of a  certain age like myself.  If you are serious enough about this game to complain about unbalanced powers, you are not the target audience."

66,saabee,7,"100%-ban hozza a Flúgos Futam hangulatot.
Esélytelen megtippelni, hogy ki fog nyerni :D A játékidő mellett abszolút megbocsátható bűnnek látom ezt. Sokkal jobban nem tudták volna implementálni a rajzfilmet társasjáték formátumba...
A Deluxe kiadást vettem meg (még szép!). Elképesztően részletesek és nagyon szépen megfestettek a figurák. Ha nem is játszik vele az ember, már azért megéri!
Inkább kisebb gyerekekkel javasolnám a játékot. Egy dobj és lépj játék felett csak picivel van a rendelkezésünkre álló ráhatás, de annál mókásabb a dolog.

71,smw88,7,My daughter is nearly 6 and we find this a fun family game that she is just about old enough to understand and follow the rules for whilst it is fast enough to complete. Not the most strategic or complex of games but fun enough.
72,Steve Be,8,Great lightweight and quick family game for fun and mild screwage.
73,submarinex1,10,Why are people reviewing a game they don't even own and best is someone who read online rulebook.  plays well with alot variation due to track and terrain cards. ai system seems to work well
74,SuperJoeUK,1.1,"Utter rubbish, totally unbalanced player powers. "
75,Sybaris,7,"This game is, in my mind, made for a family, or friends who want a light game. Now there are some tactics to use and some racers require more brain than others to get the most out of their powers. Timing the use of the right card at the right time, planning a turn or two ahead and avoiding traps are all fun things to think along the way. Our kids really like the visual of it (especially the painted cars version). We did some very small house rules (that you can find in the variants section) to put more intensity in the race. Fun times.

If you play with kids, this scores an 8."

[b]Comments:[/b] [thing=256729][/thing] is q quick racing game, filled with luck and, surprisingly, quite a lot of fun. It captures pretty well the mood and theme of the cartoon, where the most absurd things could happen - and, maybe by accident or design, a play lasts around the time of an episode!

[thing=256729]Wacky Races[/thing] is... well, about races. In his turn the person can move 1, 2 or 3 spaces, if they have cards the match the type of terrain their vehicles are in (in the first movement, any card can be used). Furthermore, each player is represented by a team, which have two unique powers, one similar (avoid a couple of types of traps) and one that is the same: discard up to three cards and draw the same number discarded. Since the decisions are mostly obvious, downtime is minimal.

The last card used by a player in their turn indicates the movement of Dick, and if he moves to the front of everyone, he lays a trap in the spot, then returns to the last place. Quite thematic!

The rules allow to make a championship, with points accordingly to how the teams finish. It fits up to 6 players, and if playing with less, the remaining spots as filled with neutral teams, that are moved by the draw deck - is totally random, but, since there is so much luck all around, they can even win races (we lost one, by the way).

The production value is high, mainly due to the great miniatures for the cards - the art is very nice also.

In the end, [thing=256729]Wacky Races[/thing] does precisely what is purposes to do: a game without any shred of seriousness, where the pilots have little control over their destinies - and this don't matter. Is a game to relax, laugh, being a tad mean (not much). It isn't balanced nor it demands much thought from the players - is even debatable if is is a truly good game,  but it fills its roll and don't try to be more than it needs or should be. As a speedy filler with a good dose of fun, [thing=256729]Wacky Races[/thing] gets a recommendation."
82,tinyclanger,3,Hmm... I wonder if the components could be repurposed into a decent game?
