4,ajewo,N/A,"HATE is a game all about 1v1 battles between barbarian tribes in addition to a campaign similar to the campaign system used by Games Workshop (Blood Bowl).

It has a very dark theme:
""Your goal is to murder your enemies and drag them back to your camp so you can torture or eat them, in order to hate them more.""

""You activate warriors in alternate turns, moving and then taking an action, which is usually attacking. Positioning is important because a lot of your minis can support the attack of other minis by standing close to the target, and because you can use higher ground to roll more dice in combat."
5,Akado,6.5,"Neat skirmish game, with campaign mechanisms and considerations.

Played as one-offs, it's just a ""beat 'em up"" with tons of casualties.  Much of the tension seems to arise from trying to medic away your dead people to safety, versus carting away the bodies of your opponents to recycle into materials (to give you bonuses in later fights).  With that removed, it's just a one-dimensional dice chucker.

I think it would be interesting to play as a campaign, as the one-off took 1 hour including teach, but it would need more than 2p to make up for the luck of dice and wound card flipluck."
6,AKHawkster,5,Definitely needs the campaign to add decision making to the scenarios.  Otherwise you just blindly blitz the objective and hope you roll better than your opponent.
7,ako_ay_bisaya,8,Surprisingly a very good tactical game. Plays quick and great miniatures to boot.

16,Arboretum,10,"We own the game and are more than happy with its outstanding production value. Personally I have not had the chance to play it yet (cannot wait to do so!) but have been present during the full length of several playthroughs where people were so happy and convinced that some had to get it for themselves, too, as soon as possible. 
These are the reasons: It is not difficult to learn, but plays extremely well and time flies while you are having a truly great time. It is immersive, exciting, versatile, you have lots to do, and it is neither too hard nor too easy to win. There is so much interaction going on all the time, even when it is not your turn, that the mere concept of ""downtime"" becomes irrelevant. The components are excellent and a joy in themselves.
The theme is dark, of course, with cannibalism and torture, but hey - it's a GAME, right? Cardboard and plastic, no harm done. It is clearly designed for an adult audience that would also e.g. enjoy horror movies. As such, it is very enjoyable indeed! And it did have one of the friendliest kickstarter communities ever, so that shows you: HATE can generate friendship and deserves some love, too."

I know some people are turned off by the theme and presentation- it really hasn't bothered me all that much (and to be fair, I expected it would, at least some).  Seems pretty good, for what it is."
19,Axelmango,4,"Excellent minis. 
Terrible battle mechanics. 
So, much potential tho..."
20,Az79,10,The Minis alone make this a ten. Gameplay loks simple but fun (easy to learn and to play) definately more a board-than a minaiture game from teh feel of it. Like the idea of the Necromunda/Blood Bowl like champaign/league play. I really really have to wonder how people think that the theme is that bad. This is not worse than Warhammer. We have zero nude characters  (the tokens abstract the idea of captives as a resource as well)  The trailer is pretty bad though at least it show the brutaility that you will see in the game (With teh minis fighting and falling over) That is all you don`t even see graphical violence on the Tribe/Village board. If words and ideas are such an offender to you than I have no idea what to say.....

I'd rather wait until the game is released and played before we sharpen pitchforks and get the torches lit.

67,Dr Locrian,8,"Not bothered by the theme, enjoyed the game play. 

There are a lot of things I like, set up is easy - easier than The Others, much easier than Arcadia quest; standalone, though not the full game, is good, it's a two player game that can be played with more, rather than a multiplayer game that can be played suboptimally with two. The rules (though with the usual cmon gaps) are straight forward aka the game is very easy to grok. Of the mechanics of the game I like the savagery management and the neat upgrade system best, it's a bit of a dice fest but there are decisions to be made. It's a quick game.

The chronicle structure makes campaign play feel like a doddle - the easiest I've seen. Minis are very well done, with several being massive troll like things bedecked with skulls, it's a bit out of control. It's a keeper, it's better than I thought it would be, it's a provisional eight which will most likely rise with more plays. The replay value appears to be sky high - just look at the number of mercenaries! Oh and this is my first cmon where I felt there was enough dice in the box, there is more than enough of almost everything in the box, see below.

Few things I don't like, because this is exclusive they didn't separate the extras from the core box, hence the box is unbelievably large, unbelievably large, the box is bad to store and not great for transport so I've ended up storing it in another box like people do with their heroscape stuff. 

You could manage with less of the regular guys, not every faction needed separate sculpts,I know this is cmon but c'mon, I would have preferred to have had more of those clip on bases than more models, so I could run two chronicles with three players a piece and not have to snap them off."

but maybe just maybe this is the most Bad thing one can say about a game: 
it is ok there is nothing that has been done tremendously wrong or any broken Elements but eh there is nothing done stellar or unique either. its just more of the same its one of many games out there.
the mechanics feel well enough with the theme but not phenomenal. you still can feel the mechanics behind the blent. and there are too few options one can take during an activation.

enjoying it while playing but there is not enough depth on any players turn to justify the Game length. it is fun for 1-2 hours but each session took us more than 3 hours (4player game) and the only real Option is playing a card to roll dice or just rolling dice by activating 2 figures (if you got enough skull ressources and/or figures to activate) and thats almost all there is. if not you trigger the end of round - each game having 4 rounds for example and dont think it fast therefore because said skulltokens can be rolled and thus a round can drag on endlessly (till each Clan figure has been activated) and this is fine - for me too and i can enjoy the simplicity behind all this  but not for over 3hours!

yeah you are right there is some more: some Upgrades some village development but come on its not that complicated and so much luck dependend - it just isnt fun for more than 2 hours at max. 
And thats it, thats my main complaint:
there are much havier Minis games out there this isnt one that i need to have in my collection while i can enjoy a few hours playing it with the right freakin group there isnt enough meat to the bones especially compared to games like lets say warhammer Shadespire.
Shadespire offers almost the exact same experience while playing much faster and more elegant with more depth and decision making through cards and objectives and assists etc. and did i mention that it plays much faster? (and come on cmon be honest you can do better or at least should do better rules/mechanic wise than hate wouldnt you say so?)

Just my 2cents for everyone else that enjoy the Game: its great for you but for me this barbarian clash doesnt click.

cheers

129,Horatiuscocles,10,"This miniatures are the highest quailty. If someone writes the looks bad its not even an opinion its just a try to destroy the public opinion of this game. Gameplay is easy and so are all war games and dice driven games. That is how it should be. Fast turns but with many many possibilities to consider. And the considering starts with chosing one from ten unique scenarios. Also when somebody don't like the post apocalyptic because of the violence dont even look on this game nor rate it based on nothing. And if somebody dont like swearing deal with it.

140,jakebwelder,9,"Fantastic game!  Each tribe gives a fairly unique play style which is surprising considering that most of the similar figures have identical stats.  The faction upgrades, shamans, and tribe tactic cards provide just enough diversity to change the play experience.  If you are adverse to losing your own models then this game may not be for you as it is really easy to have a model be KO'd in this game.  The dice can be really swingy, as dice games are, but at least it gives you the Feats of Savagery to help you mitigate this.  

Only minor problem that has come up that wasnt addressed in the quickly released faq was the turn order.  There are instances where the first player will get to go last in a round and knows he will go first the next one (as the attacker always goes first each round).  This has been game winning in several turns.  This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both players get to be the attack for a battle in the two battle clash.  So each player gets a chance to take advantage of it.  Its also hard to purposefully setup this situation as the amount of savagery you get is unpredictable.

I am loving the game so far and am just really bummed by all the people coming in here and rating the game as 1 even though they have no interest in it and will never play it to give an objective rating.  I guess ultimately it doesnt matter what this is rated since the only way you can buy this game is if some retailers happened to back the kickstarter as well.

I don´t even know why I bought Hate. CMON has a 100% of disliked games with me! I enjoy a couple of their licensed games from Cranio Creations but I don’t like the stuff they design themselves. 

Hate seems like a great game, but then again all CMON games do. They look great but when you play them, they are very shallow for my taste.

Hate´s box is humongous and I’m curious about it. When a friend saw my game, he offered to buy it and I sold it to him. Perhaps we will play it in the future but if I never do I’m not going to lose any sleep over it. It will probably be another great looking with regular gameplay CMON game.

Current Rating: N/A"
147,jkship,10,It's a adult game with dark atmosphere. It's already explained in Kickstarter. I like this style. No need to blame or curse it only because you don't like this. Just keep away from it if you don't want to play this kind of stylish game. I'm eager to play asap.

149,joelpetersen,9,"Despite the game’s horrible MRA/MAGA fanbase (of whom I suspect only very few are interested in the game rather than just being against anyone who dares criticize toxicity) the game is actually a real solid skirmish experience. The rules are pretty light, but there is a lot of details in the way the different tribes play and evolve during the game, combined with interesting and varied scenarios. The over-the-top post apocalyptic theme is very fitting with the mechanisms. 
This SJW is very pleased that I took a chance on this KS despite the cringeworthy trailer. I only wish I would have added more red dice and more terrain."

More than likely they're not expecting HATE when you bring them to the table as you see the confusion and the uncertainty form on their face. 
  What you have is quality miniatures, gameplay that isn't to complex and mechanics that look engaging with a tribe that grows and dies from game to game, and a campaign giving one the motivation to see this through start to finish. A theme of savagery, no hope for tomorrow, and the gritty realism where it's truly survival of the fittest that may appeal to many (to those of you who have been giving negative feedback  due to said themes. I say this to you; You literally were WARNED a few months back. A heads up was given about this games announcement, you had all the time in the world to do some research ((which literally takes five minutes of your time, I should know because I looked into it,)) about what this was bases off, and seriously when I found about Adrian Smith I thought the guy who plays guitar for Iron Maiden was behind it. Seriously people do ya'll hear yourself with your reasons for not liking this game? It's like saying ""I know viewer discretion is advised but I'm still gonna look at! sound like a good idea to me!""

Trying to do the full skirmishes or campaign that the game is designed for allows you to use upgrades, but results in a very long experience with lots of pauses for set up.  Also, it feels like the armies need more differentiation - they have different decks, but all the units are effectively the same from the start, which is disappointing.

I strongly believe (hope) it was meant to be funny. If so, I liked it. If it was meant to be a serious video, well then it's kind of weird. 

I usually don't mind dark and violent themes. Killing opponents during battle is part of the deal, when you play a battle game. However, the game mechanic of killing, torturing and cooking INNOCENTS does seem a bit too much. 

I guess no one at CMON is surprised that this would offend some people. I will probably buy this game anyway (I am currently in with $3 so I won't miss it), because the minis are awesome and the gameplay seems like something I would enjoy (apart from cooking innocents that is). It is simple and basic, which I actually prefer over complex. The campaign/chronicle during which your characters get stronger or scarred and weaker seems pretty cool, too. Haven't seen any game during which your characters can get weaker, either. So that's cool.

If you cannot overlook some of the offending elements or if the theme is simply not for you, then why are you even looking at this game? Let it be and buy another skirmish game that is less offending."

I appreciate how the game was made (components), the gameplay (easy to catch rules, clashes quick to complete, variety of modes, relatively quick campaign mode, a lot of interaction, minimal downtime, ideal in the mini campaign mode/Chronicles but plays great also as just a single 1v1 clash) and how entertaining it is."

The whole thing is a beast by the content perspective, with an incredible amount of wonderfully sculpted minis.

But the game in itself is something special: it has a very good learning curve, fast and brutal. It is strategically deep and every Cronicle is a living, dynamic enviroment. 

The Chronicle is key to understand the real core of HATE: it is a game about long term objectives and macroeconomy, where an unlucky match is something you must just be ready to manage. Everthing is dressed up and very well integrated into hordes of cannibal barbarians trying to eat one another. 

For some that is a minus, for me it's the cherry on the cake."

[b]Notes[/b]:
[i]This is a good example of a game that would have been an instant buy 15 years ago, but my collection has somewhere it it almost everything this game has to offer me at the moment—Well except cannibalism. I like the whole metagame between games and the unique factions, but, ultimately, I have other games that fit the 1 vs 1 skirmish game—Especially when I recently committed to The Edge: Downfall 1.6 and it’s higher price-tag. Like a lot of games I don’t own, I skip because it’s a mixture between collection redundancy, price and no one who would likely consistently want to play this often enough that I’d get to enjoy the fun meta game boards in between like the village and territory control map, but if you live in reasonable distance to Hartsdale, NY 10530 and you have a hard time getting this to the table, hit me up, because I’d be down to try it. Oh also did I mention I own WAY too many CMON Games ATM that don’t get played? Particularly my favorites from them(that I both own and have played): The Others, Blood Rage, Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, Green Horde, Rum & Bones(2e) and Bloodborne: TCG—and those are just the ones I own and have played and really like. There are 1-3 on the way or that I haven’t played like RoM: Of her Majesty’s Service, which I got on sale and looks decent enough, or the impulse purchase of Zombicide: Invader... The only CMON game that gets regular play is Xenoshyft and that’s because of the limited games my best friend and college roommate knows and he loves COOP deck-builders. All I’m saying, is that it will be a while before I buy another CMON game until I get the ones I have played and I really haven’t been blown away with them in a while as they seem to be playing it super safe or releasing another “Z” game 2.0 . The only way you’ll ever catch me buying that is if they finally give credence to my Army of Darkness wish and really clean up Z: Modern with more than just 1 new rule...but anyways—this is HATE and totally the wrong place to rant. Really I should just be Ranting why not more people want to play The Others, which is a magically tactful game or the looser Rise of Moloch, where it’s so much more fun than at 1st glance—seriously, the curse of steampunk games never end![/i]"

199,Mellekai,10,"This rating is given based on the thorough study of the rule book wip, the quality of actual existing CMON games, the design and art shown on the KS page and the fun that is induced by playing the CMON games with the light and robust rule settings. This game is a steal and CMON is brave to bring this project to us.
Addendum: I have played the game eight time now and I found now flaw. Hence I hold my previous verdict and even emphasize it because the quality of the miniatures comes in on top. Those miniatures are extremely well done and detailed. Some of them even cross the line between playing piece and art piece. They are telling stories and provide reflections of a words larger then themselves but mirrored in themselves."
200,mercopparis,7.5,"I wavered back and forth on this KS because I thought the combat was too simple and dice-deterministic. I ultimately didn't back, but got it in a trade.

Now that I've had the opportunity to play, I will say my early, personal impressions about combat were pretty close to what I thought. However, what I kind of missed was how the whole presentation came together in a pretty enjoyable skirmish experience.

I like all of the scenario options. I like that there's a mini campaign, and even though the clear stat sleeve modifiers are pretty basic when it comes down to it, it's got that ""fun factor"" that makes it a joy to use.

Production is quite high as you'd expect. My biggest complaint is how similar the character colors are. It makes it tough to distinguish; there's like a million shades of blue base color (exaggeration of course), when they could have done something else to help out. Like ""here's blue triangle base, here's light blue square base, etc."" 

I don't think anything in here blows your socks off, but it certainly feels like an enjoyable, customizable experience. It seems to have been made in a way that almost fits a tournament scene for a local store or bigger group of friends, which is a cool option."

I hope the community contributes support with new scenarios, tribe ideas, etc... I can see myself playing this game fairly regularly over the next couple years. There's lots of potential for this game, even if the gameplay is fairly simplistic compared to other wargames... I actually find the simple mechanics refreshing, sometimes you want/need simple, rather than codexes full of rules just to play a game."

213,N7Overlord,10,"Edit:

As stated before my 10/10 rating stays,  I had a chance to play the game and it is better than what I expected. 

The predetermined scenarios are very well thought and balanced.

I like the fact that there are rules to make every clash limited to specific number of rounds if none of the players has completed the main objective. So the game does not become infinite or tedious.

The minis are very detailed and have great design. The quality of the minis is pretty good too.

Playing chronicles with 4 players or more is really fun.

The packaging is awesome, after unpacking everything and playing some games it wasn't too difficult to put everything back on its place.

214,Nap16,6,"I hate Hate!  That may be too strong of a statement; but then again, Hate is a strong game.  This may be my longest entry on BGG for a game I have yet to play and do not own.  What is good about Hate?  Hate introduced me to Kickstarter.  Sure, I heard about games being Kickstarted, but never really followed any of the games in detail, let alone, considered backing one.  I followed Hate from the beginning (actually marked my calendar when it was to go live) and it was an educational process—watching the unlocking of stretch goals, add-ons, comments, fanboys and, of course, Haters.  Hate has a lot to offer:  tons of plastic (minis, large and larger, tokens, terrain, huts, trees and even severed hands . . . I mean resources); extra bits (enough to play 2-3 games simultaneously); RPGish-legacy-lite chronicle system that tracks your tribe’s development over the course of the game, innovative character/unit tracking with transparent sleeves;  and theme oozing with theme bleeding on theme ... that was actually one of the detractors.  The theme is mature, in-your-face, gritty, taboo and takes-no-prisoners . . . well, only to eat or torture for resources or hate, respectfully.  Not my cup of tea—but not enough of a reason to shy away from it.  I like The Others with its dark, sinister, cultish theme, as well as other games with more mature content.  No, it came down the gameplay.  This is a miniature skirmish game played on a board. I have that. Maybe this is better; but is it THAT much better?  If the theme grabbed me, then . . .maybe . . . I would jump in; but as I said, the theme is more of a distraction than a selling point. In fact, the Kickstarter video did not do itself any favors in that regard.  So, will I back it . . . unfortunately, no.  For $120 you get a lot—as it currently stands, 8 tribes (88 extremely well done minis); 14 mercs (with one on the bubble); tons of plastic bits (including spiked skulls and severed hands), extra boards, terrain tiles and game play options— so much you really do not need any of the add-ons (which are pretty cool by themselves).  I just do not see getting my play-value out of it (especially with my gaming group).   For those who backed, enjoy your Hate—embrace it.  There is a whole lot of Hate to love. If you paint, good luck every getting through all that. If you love miniature skirmish games, then Hate may just scratch your itch – the system seems straightforward with some new twists that are not overly complicated.  If that kind of theme is your bag, then fill it up with Hate! For me, I’ll take a pass. If someone I know gets a copy—I will gladly play it (actually would love to see/play it).  Just do not think I need to own right now (which is a tough pass, given it’s a KSE).  All in all, I want to thank Hate for taking my on this journey. I learned more about Kickstarter, what I like, what my game group (mostly my family) would like, a better understanding my current play-value quotient, but most importantly, I found some other games that I did Kickstart (one backed, as my first on KS and another that I am seriously considering).  I would have not found these, if I had not started following Hate. I need to thank Hate for helping me find games truer to my heart.  Revising my opening statement—I do not hate Hate . . . Hate is where the heart is . . .

Finally able to play the game and most of my reservations were confirmed ... solid game, awesome minis ... but game play is just okay and theme is still very mature ... there is a whole lot there (even just in the Tyrant’s pledge), so if this is your cup of tea, or cup of whatever ... enjoy!

The rules are terribly incomplete and vague though, which can lead to a lot of frustration and discussion forum time initially. Even with the FAQ 1.0 it did not get much better.

The theme resonates with a lot of people, especially board gamers, the majority love Mad Max  and this is basically it.

Did it really need the vulgar language, nudity, and excessive violence to make the theme ring? No it didn't, that's proven by the success of Mad Max.

Taking this approach has alienated a large amount of players and I really think they shot themselves in the foot. I would have loved to back this KS but before I could even get to the gameplay/rules etc., they lost me. 

So I'll rate it 3 because I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (BloodRage and Rising Sun are awesome) as far as mechanics go. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed that it's not something I will ever play simply because of the unwise implementation of the art/theme."

251,salsadma,6,"From a gaming standpoint, I feel the seperation of the game into 1v1 skirmishes is problematic for a game up to 6 players can play. Becomes especially problematic with an uneven number of players, as it means you have a player that just sits and looks at what the others are doing without being able to participate in the game for a long period."
252,Sam and Max,5,"Miniatures are great. Board and other components are bland. The introductory scenario doesn't show off the scars, upgrades, and other campaign mechanics the game promised, and the mechanics reduce down to the usual ""more swords than shields"" dice-rolling that Ameritrashers have had since forever. The game does have an unusual action point mechanic, where you can generate action point currency as you roll dice in battles, but this mechanic still doesn't raise the game beyond the usual ""more bips than baps"" rolling that you've seen before. 

I'll pick up the game if I can get it on the cheap so I can use the miniatures for other games. The miniatures make MUCH better (and threatening) barbarian miniatures, as an alternate to the overused loincloth barbarian.

As for the mature theme and moral outrage... the SJW's don't have anything to worry about. Ameritrashers have more concern, as CMON puts out yet another dice-chucker with custom dice."

The minis are awesome... lots of material and I'm really excited to start and play a whole campaign next month (my friends are already invited). Then I will update my rating. The rules are simple but I take it as a chance to have a real fast paced game, hoping to play a whole campaign within one week end (2 tables). To the people complaining about the mature / childish Theme : this is a game / this is a Universe (how can you even possibly think one second the oven are a nazi reference?) and for me it is obvious that the communication of CMON on this one was volontarily exagerated. Take it with irony...and humour... or be offended but in any case I find inappropriate to rate a game you do not possibly own (to all the trolls of 2018). My message to BGG : disable ratings for games that are not yet out and if it is possible cancel the ones that have been done in that manner. It simply does not make sense..."

Obviously the game isn’t for everyone, kinda like Hellraiser or horror in general isn’t for most...but to bash something your not into is a waste of your energy, stick to what you like and go away!
Your not gonna sway any of us who are into this sort of thing, basically your opinion is a waste of space. 

Also, I love this theme and the game play doesn’t look to complex, so it’ll be fun to learn and play right away!

1) two many unclear rules.  The rules need a 10 page FAQ IMHO to clear up all of the unclear rules.
2) if you are color-blind to certain color shades like I am you will have a hell of a time distinguishing between the different blue and geek shades of figure bases"

The balance of the tribe cards is its worst issue, in my opinion."

310,Vilcito,N/A,"Muy buen juego estilo wargame skirmish, para ser un juego de mesa. Es muy sencillo pero entretenido. Como ya venían 8 tribus diferentes permite mucha variedad, ya que aunque los perfiles son muy parecidos las 8 tribus tienen mecánicas diferentes y eso le da vidilla, además del factor azar que hace que rara vez haya 2 partidas iguales. La calidad de las minis es brutal y la temática personalmente me encanta, así que me he llevado una grata sorpresa con el juego, me esperaba muy buenas minis pero un juego mediocre y me encontrado un buen juego (para principiantes en juegos de escaramuzas) y que es fácil sacarle mesa. Aunque es para 2-4 lo normal es o 2 o 4, a 3 jugadores es un coñazo, aunque viene con lo propio para jugar 4 tanto en 2v2 como hacer 2 partidas 1v1 simultáneamente."
