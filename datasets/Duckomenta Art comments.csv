2,4Corners,7,"What do you get when you take a well-respected card game with a great auction mechanic, and then strip out that auction mechanic?  Modern Art: the card game.  While the title seems absurd and/or like a quick easy way to make a buck off an existing successful franchise, this game actually really hit the spot for me.

I really like Modern Art.  I suck at it, but I really like it.  Unfortunately, my wife does not and neither do one of my main gaming groups.  Also, Modern Art cannot be played two-player.  Now along comes Modern Art: the card game (I still find this title hilarious), and it only costs $12, it's amazingly portable, and it does play 2-player.  It has the Modern Art ""theme"" (including the same artwork), and it actually plays very similary in terms of feel and strategy despite completely lacking any auctions.  

It's all about timing and set collection, and of course it helps to have the cards with abilities (like draw an extra card, play 2 cards of the same time in a row, add an extra 2 points to the artist, etc.).  I have only played this 2-player so far, but I have to say it's quickly becoming a travel game of choice for me and my wife.  Surprisingly good, simple game."

LIKE: different style of game. light. interesting mechanism.
DISLIKE: graphic design is dated. scoring is fiddly and needs pencil paper.

OVERALL: needs more play and with more players. may be better with more than 2 players. also, someone did analysis of playing styles, the ""tortoise"" (slow and steady) vs ""hare"" (save all cards until the end) play styles, seems balanced. could use money chips to make it more involved."

63,Blott,6,"When I first heard about this game I couldn't help thinking that Modern Art without auctions sounded like a pretty hollow experience to me. And, honestly, in comparison to Modern Art this is a fairly hollow game, but as a light filler game it kind of works. The mechanisms are very simple, and it makes you think on every turn because you want to get in on the most prolific artists without tipping your hand to your opponents. I actually enjoyed playing, which surprised me, and I think I might hang onto the game for now because it can give me a somewhat Modern Art experience in a shorter timeframe. Perhaps the biggest demerit against this game is that they took away the variety of art, and depict the same painting on every single card for a particular artist. This sucks any theme that existed in the original game out, and suddenly I feel like they could have slapped any theme on this mechanism without changing the experience. In fact you could almost play with an ordinary set of playing cards. Regardless it's still a decent card game, which maybe only suffers because it is named after a truly great one."

Definitely not on par with the classic Modern Art, and if you compare the two, Master's Gallery certainly gets the short end of the stick. But as its own game, this is a good and interesting lightweight game that succeeds where Trendy and some of Knizia's other featherweights failed. For me, this is in a good spot - clever, interesting, well-paced with skillfully managed tension, and enough depth to fill the game time - not on par with his bigger games for depth or theme, but also simple and short. Not a classic, but fun, and more than it appears, as is usual for Knizia."

This is a quick filler game for sure, but a durned clever one. The mechanics of the game cleverly mimic faddish mobs chasing after the new hot thing (thematic!), and there's some room for clever and creative play in here.

For reasons probably related to the fact that I own iOS versions of this and two other short card games by the good Dr. Knizia (Money! and High Society), I tend to lump the three together. They're all good games, all with simple rules and exactly one ingenious mechanic apiece that sets them apart. Take your pick but you won't be disappointed."
115,Coffeebike,6,"8+ plays face to face (3p, 4p, 5p) -- like it, and a little wary of the luck factor, but still like it. Reminded me a bit of Trendy and Merchant as well as classic Modern Art-with-the-auctions. Bought my own copy. Update: Played iOS version as well... Not sure what is the right rules!! Which is the best way to play? Weird, possibly problem that in analog printed rules, players may run out of cards before 4th, even 3rd round. There's a logic to it, but it seems unKnizia-like to me to have players sitting out some rounds. ...I like it OK (above average, not great excitement). But... what I really like about it (worthy of a higher rating): it seems to have a nice value as tiny-box, cheap, easy-to-play social card game that is popular with different social groups, and has a fresh-feeling twist on mechanisms. Based on one play with 3p, I think it is better with 4p or 5p."

117,CortexBomb,6,"Knizia seems to be on a tear redesigning and repackaging old ideas lately. I'm still waiting for The Lost Cities Dice Game and Ra the Dexterity Game but for the time being we have Modern Art: The Card Game.

The game features the artists of Modern Art with Modern Art style card distribution. It plays almost nothing like MA though, as player turns consist of just playing a card for an artist. Some of the cards allow players to play bonus cards face down, allow everyone to secretly select a bonus card and then simultaneously reveal, and to place a bonus 2 point chip on an artist that sticks with them. Rounds end like MA when the sixth painting is played for an artist and then score 3/2/1 points for 1/2/3 finish, and like MA the score chips accumulate over the course of the game and all pay out if the artist finishes in the top 3 again. Oh yes, and at the end of the round you can also play out a bonus card for each artist that placed, provided you had at least one of them out to begin with. 4 rounds of this and high score wins.

I think the title of this game is actually a bit of a misnomer despite the similarities to the base game in terms of how the round ends and how the scoring system works. The reason I say this is because it isn't an auction game, and the way I would explain MA is ""the most pure and delightful auctions only game that I have ever played."" Because this isn't an auction game, it has very little of the feel of its namesake for me, with the hand management being the only real remaining glimmer.

I don't mean to come across as overly negative though, this is a fairly charming filler. It's not as deep as true all stars like High Society, but it has some interesting decisions. Granted, the amount of blind card play can be irksome, but in a game of this length it's not a particularly big deal either. Fast players should easily be able to play this in 15 minutes or so."

Simple play a card type game, where players gradually grow an art collection.  A scoring round is triggered when six (or five) cards of an artist hit the table, with the three top artists for the round paying out points.  Repeat for four rounds.  Essentially a blend of two fantastic games - Modern Art (sans auctions) and Trendy (group-think popularity contest), and the combination works very well.

157,drasher25,7,"My initial reaction to this game was that taking the auctions out of Modern Art was just a crazy idea, and MA is renown for being one of the premier pure auction games.  But as I thought about, I realized that what I enjoy about MA is the manipulation of the artist values through the card play.  The auctions were just a way to get to that, and were actually not the most interesting part of the game.  In fact, I wonder if the reason that MA has so many different kinds of auctions is that they are not all that compelling on their own.  

So, after this reflection, I'm thinking I would rather own Master's Gallery than Modern Art for a few reasons:

1) The valuation you need to do to play MA makes the game rather tough for newbies and also rather fragile.  Someone who misvalues a painting or two can easily hand the game to someone else.

2) I really prefer the use of actual classic paintings in MG.  

3) Having the essence of MA in a easy-to-teach filler package means I will get to play it a lot more.

4) Frankly, I have other games that I would rather play than MA when I'm in the mood for an auction.  I think many of Knizia's own games have more interesting auction systems.  I'd rank the auctions in Ra, Medici, Hollywood Blockbuster, Tower of Babel, Taj Mahal, Beowulf: The Legend all above MA for fun factor. 

UPDATE: Sept 2014
FINALLY played the game, and as I suspected, the auctions are the worst thing about Modern Art.  In contrast, Master's Gallery is a wonderful distillation of the best aspects of Modern Art.

Interesting and relatively quick game of painting set collection.

It offers interesting and not so obvious decision making and it is on just right amount of fun to be considered occasional filler.

Modern Art is a great game, but he took the jewel of it - the popularity scoring methodology - and applied it to Master's Gallery, re-jigging it as a streamlined hand management game dispensing with all the (4 different types of) auction malarkey.  I like the quick 4 round game length, the irregular hand re-deals (which really makes players choose to either play cards now or save them for later rounds).  Really tough choices, hidden information that always leads to a tense finish, but never overstays its welcome.  The theme is completely pasted-on, but the art and artists selection is excellent (though Vermeer seems the odd man here vs all the impressionists).  Easier to get to the the table than Modern Art, Master's Gallery is a beautifully streamlined 25min game, fun to play, and one which I very much enjoy playing."

219,Gola,7,"Two  plays with two, six plays with three, and two with four. If Trendy and Modern Art got married and had a child, it would look a lot like this game. There's a little more planning ahead in MA:tCG than in Trendy, because you get more cards up front, but the special-icon cards add back some uncertainty. It's important to mention that you're not necessarily going to like MA:tCG just because you like the original Modern Art, though; they're very different games, even if they share a theme and some mechanical ideas. 

The game is pretty entertaining and can even be a bit thinky at times as players adjust to each others' card plays and try to guess who will be a friend to their cause and who will be an enemy. Some of the special cards add even more strategy into the mix, but the bad thing about these cards is that you need to draw your share of them in order to have a shot at winning. If you never get any that let you play two cards in a turn, you're pretty much out of the running.

How ""gamerly"" the game is going to be depends heavily on how many people are playing; there's a lot more control in the three-player game than in the four-player game. I probably wouldn't bother bringing it out with five. It also works okay with two, though. 

[b]ADDENDUM:[/b] I just tried the iOS version of the game and discovered that I'd missed a rule for those ten plays. Dang!

224,gschloesser,6.5,"After playing Masters Gallery from Reiner Knizia, I joked with Keith Blume of Gryphon Games that my review would be just one sentence:  ""It is Modern Art without the bidding.""  Truth-be-told, this is an accurate description, as the game feels very similar to the famous board game, sans the bidding.  One would initially suspect that removing the bidding would strip the game of its primary element and reduce it to a bland shadow of its predecessor.  Surprisingly, that is not the case, as the card game version, while simpler and quicker, is actually quite fun.

Masters Gallery and its twin The Modern Art Card Game plays in a very similar manner as their ancestor, Modern Art.  Of course, the major element missing is the auctions.  Here, players actually play and possibly score the cards they are dealt as opposed to placing them up for auction.  Removing the auction does simplify the game and remove an element that some fans of the original game might find abhorrent.  Fair enough.  However, I would urge folks not to prematurely dismiss this new game, as it is quite fun and some interesting decisions to make.  Yes, it can be frustrating to play your artists in attempts to land them in the top spots, only to have your opponents play different artists and shut you out of the scoring.  I also wish a score pad or chart had been included.  These, however, are not enough to significantly detract from my enjoyment of the game.  It works well as a light game to open or close an evening, or at family gatherings.  Indeed, it may even find wider audience than its predecessor, which was more involved and required more skill to play well.  Masters Gallery is accessible is more easily accessible, and should have broader appeal.  However, as it is in the real art world, I'm certain there will be appreciation for both the masters and the modern artists!"

Modern Art is truly a classic and when I heard this is no longer an auction, that seemed disappointing.  

The truth is, while Modern Art is not replacable, this is a great little game that works very well even without an auction.  

Pretty much ALL the same elements are here except the auction. You have a hand of cards, as do others, and you still need to speculate on what to play, how and when, so you collect sets in front of you just by playing cards.  Instead of different auctions he gave some cards some different special powers to juice them up, so there is a bit of card draw luck here.  

I played this with 2 and it worked very well and was over in 10 - 15 minutes, so a great filler. There could be a problem with 2 where the 5 card max does not get filled, not sure and there must be a workaround (ie if all cards get spent, take 3 extra cards than normal next round)

292,JoSch,5,"Instead of bidding for works in auctions players draw and play them directly. The principle of participating and at the same time determining the scoring exhibitions works again. A major drawback is the lack of an element mitigating the luck of the card draws which was done by the auctions in Modern Art. If, in the card game, an opponent gets twice as much cards allowing to play additional cards, there's not much to compensate for this. Other than that it's a decent filler."
293,jtakagi,7,"For comments on game play, see Modern Art: the Card Game.

The components, again, are just as flimsy.  Chinese produced box, low-quality cards.  I give the game one point higher than MA:tCG because it has different paintings on each artist's cards rather than the same painting, which I thought was really stupid.  There's something to be said for the silliness of the original artists, but I think that Masters Gallery will be a better game to use to introduce non-gamers as the artists are a pretty good hook."
294,jtakagi,6,"Of course there is a relationship to Modern Art in the scoring system, but I see this more closely related to Trendy, in which groupthink is very important, forcing you to work together with the other players somewhat, but still needing to set yourself apart with the right artist to get the lead.  

My main gripe with the game is in the production quality.  The card stock is very thin and doesn't feel durable at all.  And it is ridiculous that there is only a single image used for each artist.  For this reason alone I would probably prefer to play Masters Gallery in the future."

Some cards have special abilities where you may have face down cards that score.  The most cards of certain color gets 3 points, 2nd get 2 and 3rd gets 1 point.  You then score points based on number of cards played multiplied by the score of each color.

This is similar to Modern Art (Knizia's classic auction game, heretofore referred to as MA Auction) without the auction. This version of the game (released as Modern Art - The Card Game, heretofore referred to as MA Card) was released using the same artists from MA Auction). Then there was a re-theme of MA Card (called Master's Gallery) where they decided to drop the identical artists from MA Auction (probably b/c they were worried that people would confuse the new MA Card with the classic MA Auction) and re-themed it using classic (and very beautiful) pieces of art.

See Ender's Game review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/404682

While I very much enjoy MA Auction, I think that MA Card (or more specifically Master's Gallery) has enough of a different game play to make it worth owning (even though I have MA Auction). Additionally, the beauty of the classic artists make the game feel very educational (in a positive way). And this too adds to the reasons for wanting it (even though we already have MA Auction). MA Card (or Master's Gallery) also offers 2 player playability (since there is no auction taking place)."

446,pfctsqr,8,"One of my favorite card fillers.  It keeps the scoring system of the original Modern Art but ditches the auctions.  Hence the game becomes one of hand management and timing.  You must decide which round is best to use the special ability cards and you must keep an eye as to which artists have the potential to score big in the final rounds.  Some people believe the game was stripped of its soul when the auctions were removed, but this version has much less of the ""poor play by one hands the game to a certain player"" syndrome.  "

I love this one. You need to do math to compute the score, and sometimes with many players a round can end quickly not giving the last player many opportunities to play scoring artwork, but I am amazed how difficult it is to win consistently at this game.

468,pusboyau,6,"Yeah, it may look like Modern Art minus auctions but this version feels like Trendy with superpowers which doesn't seem to benefit mankind. The first play with 3 showed the devastating effect a player with too much power can have on accruing huge bounds in scoring, whilst stamping out hope which no canny player can recover from. Befitting their artistic themes, Masters Gallery is a quiet, thoughtful approach whereas Trendy, though shallow and quick has always been a fun outing. Difficult to say whether less or more than 3 will effectively address the superpower issue, though the game may stay alittle longer in the collection for educational purposes. 

Update: I think 4 may be the sweet spot in regards to a balance of control and chaos, though I think the power icons may still be an issue. So the game is interesting in the latter aspect as to how  play well with the hand dealt so rating up a point. However, I can't warm to the game because of the fractured scoring (tokens fragments it further) whereas compared to Trendy where you have a comparative 'feel' as to how you are doing. Now starting to think 2 player may be best."

Meglepetés volt a Modern Art kártyaváltozata. Kicsit a Botswana jutott róla eszembe, de persze más a játék. Lapokat játszunk ki a kezünkből öt színben, ha valamiből kijön a hatodik, akkor vége a fordulónak. A legtöbb szín 3, a második 2, a harmadik 1 pontot ér kijátszott laponként. 4 fordulós játékban ezek a pontok mindig hozzáadódnak az előzőekhez így egy-egy szín egyre értékesebb lesz. Az egyszerűséget az egyes lapokon található bónusz lépések adják. Plusz kártya kijátszás, laphúzás, stb. Nagyon jó volt 3-an és 5-en is. Egyszerű, mégis van min gondolkodni. Talán nem túl nehéz a jó stratégia megtalálása, illetve a szerencsén múlik elég sok, de alapvetően nagyon jó kis átvezető játék. Erős hatos."

A másik dolog, ami felmerült, hogy hogyan lehet egy teljesen az aukciókról szóló játékot úgy kártyásítani, hogy a szerző kiveszi belőle az aukciókat. Elég bizarul hangzik, de itt éppen ezt történt.

593,turtlecolor,7,"I really like this game.......played it two player so far, and I really appreciate the feeling, mechanisms and strategy..........it exceeded my expectations by far.....and i can't wait to play it again and again...........get this game.........i will let you and me know more as i sink more into a non-knew game that i have fallen in love with mentality........long live reiner

Update: The hottest game at our week long vacation with my brother's family.......played many games.....currently our favorite card game......elegant, strategic, aesthetically pleasing, well balanced, perfect amount of luck to keep old and new hands at the game at a somewhat equal level......after one game, you start the ""ah-ha! I will do that!""  love it...going up to a 9 out of respect......will update as we go

can't stop playing update............love it.

594,Twinge,7.5,Different enough from Modern Art to justify its existence.  Some interesting hand management plus 'work with your neighbor but try to get the better deal' aspects.
595,Tycho,6,"Played with 4 or 5. Each player had at best two turns per round, mostly all playing only one or two artists.  Would like to try it with fewer people/more turns. *Have now played both Masters Gallery and MA:tCG, the former is much the nicer production.*"

601,Verkisto,6,"I like that the game takes the basic system of Modern Art and simplifies it to a streamlined, faster game that manages to maintain the same feel of its pappy.  That being said, the game is so simplified that people who are big fans of Modern Art probably won't be too impressed with it.  For those people who like the payout system, and want that same experience in a shorter playtime, then the card game will probably scratch that itch.  Since it still requires the same hand management skills to do well in the game, it really maintains the feel of the original game.

1 play: 3 players"

605,voynitsky,6,"Played the Duckumento Art version. Fun, quick, auction game. Bit too luck dependant, but still good."
606,wakakafat,7,Better than I expect but Modern Art is definitely much better
607,Walt Mulder,7,Great filler that supports 5.
608,Wassail Games,8,Modern Art without the auctions - therefore quicker. As a filler it is excellent. If get to play more often the rating may go up.
609,Waylander1,5,"Nothing wrong with this one, but nothing worth talking about either."
610,Wentu,7.5,"After the first round of my first game i thought this was an extremely silly and meaningless game.
At the end of my second game I think this is an incredibly smart game, so simple yet so interesting.
Yes, there can be rounds that end immediately but it means you are not planning ahead for your next rounds!
It's like Modern Art but without what makes Modern Art a great game... and yet, this is also a great game!
Oh, So far i just played it in two and i think it will be much much better in 4 or 5!

I have the duck edition and i must add that the art is truly funny!"

613,wigrend,6.8,"The artwork was poor in the version I played, but the game has potential. Hard to judge how much depth there is in the game since it felt like the game played itself in some ways (the cards delt was really important). Will consider raising the rating after a couple of plays. "
614,wiley1za,6,"A little too pared down - I was wanting something like what I've read of Modern Art itself and this is far simpler and pared down. Great art on the cards and interesting scoring, but not a keeper for me."
615,willdeworde,8,Quick and addictive. Simplified version of Modern Art without the auctioning.

620,wkusau,6,After 1 play. Slightly different from the original. Different symbols on the cards. Not quite as good.
621,woodnoggin,3,But Modern Art is already a card game.
622,worshipsf,7,I actually like this one better than full Modern Art! MUCH faster to play and not as much pressure for calculating the value of everything.

Bidding is just not fun for me.

626,xsoulbrothax,N/A,"Very disappointing compared to the old 'green box' Modern Art - no bidding/auction mechanic, which was our favorite part of the out of print game!"
627,Yacoff,6,"This takes a relatively light game, and makes it even lighter by removing the bidding aspect. 

I can appreciate a streamlined game, as I think Coloretto is a better game than Zooloretto as the interesting aspect of the game is retained and the fat is cut away (or rather ft was added to make Zooloretto), but in this case as interesting part was removed to make a more simplistic and less interesting game."

629,Zalasta,6.5,"I didn't really care for the auction part of Modern Art, so to me this is the preferred version if I were to play it.  I no longer need to guess at the value of the art, instead, I formulate my strategy base on the cards in my hands and those in people's tableau.  The only thing I don't like is that the game is skewed in favor of those who end up with most of the special cards, especially ones that let you play another piece.  A nice retooled edition."
630,zarajess,4,"Ok, but very little replay value. Not much going on in this game."
631,zedeemia,8,A fantastic little card game that offers plenty of turn angst and tension. The scoring conditions are really interesting and provide for plenty of entertaining moments.
