Game plays pretty quickly, too, turn to turn, which is always a plus with these things. Somewhat disappointed at all the KS stuff; just means even if I pick it up, I'll feel it's not quite complete.

Monter des héros en puissance sympa avec l'achat de matériel en fin de scénario pour le scénario suivant et règles simples à assimilées.

Par contre petit bémol pour le dernier scénario qui est en fin de compte le moins intéressant et trop tourné PvP à notre gout."
13,aenrith,9,"My friends really enjoy playing this game. Competitive is always fun, but we retweaked rules to create a fun, yet challenging coop experience."
14,aersult,9,"Great dungeon crawler. Fun mechanics to interact with monsters and opponent characters. Some of the rules cam get murky, but the available online FAQ is pretty helpful (if long). House rules are easy to implement. Plenty of variety in multiple playthroughs, and the final level helps to keep those who are falling behind more interested.
Wish it had an expansion to add more players.
Also, being a campaign-style game, it can be difficult to organize game nights so campaigns can last months (depending on the people; not the games' fault)."
15,Afirm8,9,"Awesome miniatures, great game!"
16,agent easy,8,"Really fun game with the right crowd. Best played with 4 due to the simetrical board layouts, but slow players can really kill it.

Cons: Dice game, Need the right mentality people to enjoy it"
30,Akindor,7,"Very fun to run through a dungeon with a *group* of heroes... racing other players' groups of heroes. Being able to carry over progress and items in the campaign is very nice, too, unlike in Zombicide (aside from the 2.0 update). Dice rolling to succeed at attacks, though, remains as fantastic and (more often) frustrating as always, keeping this more in the ""game of chance"" arena than I'd like. Beautiful minis and worth owning if you have a group you can play through a whole campaign with."
31,akositosi,8,Fun but a bit luck-dependent monster bashing game. the set up and teardown time is too long. Some characters are overpowered. Good production though.

33,Akroatis,10,"OMFG! This is a REAL game, its amazing! "
34,Al Capwnd You,7,"Cute art, fun gameplay, and neat upgrade system. A bit too much ""take that"" for my tastes, but the punishment isn't too severe. Also due to the mini-campaign nature, it makes for a longer game than I'd like."
35,albcann,8.5,"This game is awfully fun. It is essentially a ""tongue in cheek"" version of Descent:  Journeys in the Dark, 2nd edition ... but player vs player rather than player(s) vs overlord and without much of a story.  Gloomhaven and Mage Knight have replaced Descent for me, with Arcadia Quest filling the niche for me for when I want to battle my buddies rather than working together."
36,albertfromsd,9.5,"Love this game!

Set up is a chore, and new players will feel overwhelmed by all the conditions and rules of attacking, moving, enemy behavior, etc. 

BUT it really isnt too bad, and for those willing to learn, the game is very rewarding. I especially love acquiring new equipment for the next round, effectively leveling up and choosing which hero abilities I want to use."
37,AlBundy4td,10,Light dungeon crawl that easy to pick and has a quick campaign.  Played with my 11 and 9 yr old nephew/nieces.
38,alcofa,5,Jogos do tipo Dungeon Crawler realmente não são para mim... Achei mais do mesmo
39,Alderdust,9,The game is light and fun. The critical mechanic is unique and the miniatures are gorgeous! 
40,alenen,8,"1st play: First play with Wife, 9 and 7 yr old. The 9 year old really liked it, she had fun picking her guild and the fact that there were girl heroes to choose from was a big selling point for her. I really liked the art style and tongue-in-cheek delivery of the characters and plot line.  The game is dead simple, and I'll be interested to see how well the game goes over with gamers.

2nd play: Probably the best dudes on a map, dungeon crawly game I have played.  The action is fast, the exploding dice are excellent, and the PvE objectives are hard.  When you complete them it feels like an accomplishment.  Each mission completed allows you to strengthen and grow your heroes without allowing the winner to run away with the game.  I wish the minis were painted already, I may have to try my hand."

43,allbroke,4.5,"A fun dungeon crawl with minis. The 15-ish minute setup time makes it hard for me to bring this to the table; When a game can only last 45-70 minutes it's less frequent that I want to take it out.

I find that the luck of dice doesn't appeal much to me. While they often roll in my favor, I feel bad for others when they don't.

I also find that I don't really care about miniatures one way or the other. They're neat... and have resulted in some funny moments but eh."

I love this game.
The models are awesome and so much fun, the rules and gameplay is amazing. We have been having a blast running though the quest book. 
Some quests get heated, with the backstabbing and killing, but no character seems over power and invincible.  "
52,amiller01,8,"Setup time takes a little too long to hit the table as often as liked. But when it does it's enjoyable. However, some maps have PvE objectives where one is much easier and quicker than the other. Some people may not like the common occurrence where a player will achieve the easier one and pretty much have the game locked up because of that. The rest of the game is too colourful to not paint all the minis, which I am slowly doing before starting a campaign in earnest. One problem I have with it is that the rules regarding occupancy and visibility, while not heavy themselves, are just complex enough to stick out like a sore thumb among the other rules. I wish is was slightly simpler to the point that it'd be more intuitive and I'd barely have to teach that aspect at all."

65,AnotherHorrorFan,8,"Finally got to actually play this at KublaCon. It is everything I knew it would be. It feels like the lite zany aspects of a game like Mario Kart mixed with a dungeon crawl. Unfortunately my painting project of it is ongoing so it will not hit my table until it's complete. Which is extra tragic since the KS for Inferno goes up two days from right now.

2017-02 Update: Increasing my score. Got to play a micro campaign of this which is where the game really sings. Really wish I could play more often.

2019-02 Update: I still love this game. I don't play it enough but I still feel that Mario Kart analogy through and through. There is oodles of content for Arcadia Quest and I went all in on Starcadia Quest. I love these games so much it's making me think I need to reappraise Masmorra. Fantastic stuff and a blast to paint. 

2020-04: Adjusted the score to balance my collection scores out a bit, but my sentiment about the game has not changed at all. I do suspect however, that once I get to play Starcadia Quest Arcadia's score will start to drop in earnest. "

I received an offer for the value of the collection.  As much as I enjoyed the game when I first started collecting it, I have only played it twice in two years.  With over 5 boxes of AQ content, two plays in two years, and someone willing to buy all of it, it finally became time to let it go.  "

I only played one game, and I imagine it would be more fun if I played a campaign, but I don't have a regular gaming group, so that's not an option for me. As a single game, I'd rate this a 5; however, since it's designed to be played as a campaign, I'll reserve judgment."

The characters each have interesting powers and mixing and matching will lead to some interesting decisions.

There is very little decision space, and any attempt at planning is thwarted by garbage dice rolls. The concept of PvPvE in an RPG environment where you get to level up / gear out a group of characters is awesome, but the execution in this game falls short of any expectation I have for a gaming experience. 

Nothing cool ever happens - you upgrade your equipment, so what? For the most part it's get another re-roll, roll another white/black die, or some other minor contrivance. 

I can't even say this is a good beer and pretzels game, or a kids game, because of the fiddliness of it all. 

I tried to love this one, and I've given up. I'm never playing this game again."

150,BiteTheDust,7.5,"Arcadia Quest is a fun and light ""all-out-brawl"" sort of game. You maneuver your clan of 4 heroes and attack monsters and other clans, while collecting items and gold.

By far the funnest part of the game is spending your hard-earned gold at the end of a particular quest to get improved gear. The gear is varied and remains exciting throughout the campaign.

The biggest down-side to the game is the amount of luck involved in attacking and defending. Every time you roll a critical, you get to roll the dice again, and if you get another one, you roll again, and again. Sometimes you can cause devastating damage just out of sheer luck, and this has turned off a lot of people who I have played with.

If you are OK with the possibility of dying frequently due to your lack of luck or due to the incredible luck of your opponents, then this game should be a worthy addition to your library.

I strongly feel that the game can be enjoyed fully without the kickstarter expansions.  The 12 characters that come with the base games give a substantial variety of gameplay.  Your team of characters can be different every game, which shakes things up every game.

We finished playing through the base game campaign recently.  One player won 5 of the 7 scenarios and the other two were won by a second player.  I'm starting to worry that there is a snowball effect as those that win often have more coins and upgrade faster than other players. "
172,Bond8089,6,"Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game perfectly replicates a hack and slash video game (Castle crashers?) into a boardgame.  You solve the puzzle how to optimize your hero actions, you kill a bunch of bad guys & get a bunch of loot.  The game is a bit fiddly since there is no ""bad guy"" turn, but once you get the hang of it all, the game runs pretty smooth.  Definitely fun for what it is, and I do expect to play the heck out of it.  "
173,Boneidolmatt,8.5,"Really enjoy this campaign game - each sitting is well paced with little downtime and the frantic dice rolling cause some surprises and plenty of shouting and jeering amongst you and your fellow players.

I love this game and it has been a very popular game when my family gets together to game. No one takes it super seriously with the character drafting mostly being done based on appearance rather than power.

The figures are also great to paint. I've spent a lot of hours unwinding while getting this game painted up."

181,bourne42,8,"This is a campaign game where you take your team of heroes through multiple missions over (probably) multiple play sessions. Game play is on a grid with dice combat. There are quests to kill the other players and a quest specific for each mission which everyone races to complete. 

A fun legacy game and fairly well balanced from mission to mission, keeping people who do well from rocketing ahead. There are some OP characters (we've noticed Spike), and getting a lot of defense is generally OP in late game. 

Acquiring loot and harder enemies makes playing multiple missions exciting and different as you keep playing through a campaign.

210,Caitlin147,10,"VERY fun to play. I got this at PAX East 2016 and we then played a game (with most rules wrong because they were demo'd wrong accidentally and we didn't read the rulebook before starting) then 3 stages of the campaign over the course of the weekend. Then I got home and Allan and I started another campaign and played 2 stages.

It is most fun when you don't care about winning and are just running around having a good time. Vinny and Allan had a ridiculous rivalry that went on a long time, which was pretty funny but caused them to lose the game. We keep getting rules wrong, because there are a LOT, but I honestly continue to love the game even with wrong rules. Most important is to play for fun! 

Update: just finished a full campaign with Allan. I got 5/5 medals (we shared 1) and he got 1/5 but won the final scenario. I guess I can see why people find it frustrating, but we honestly had a great time with the whole campaign. We actually recorded which cards we have so that we can do the poison dragon expansion when it arrives! We might do a 2 player variant that includes a 3rd PvE quest (probably ""kill 3 monsters"" just to make the games last a tiny bit longer. The 5th scenario, Allan really wanted to complete one of the PvE's, but ended up finding a quest token really early, so he went to take it back to his starting area. I tried to steal it but he killed me instead, so when he got to the starting area he was actually disappointed that he won, since the game had barely happened. But that was all luck of the quest token placement to be honest. Seriously awesome game!"

298,CptJadeDash,7.5,I haven’t been able t play through a whole campaign yet. I keep starting with new people and so the game is losing its appeal of being able to continue to power up and fight through quests. Hopefully one day I will have a good group to play through a whole campaign with.

Rated 7 (I Like It) as of Aug '18 (2 plays) - I like D&D style games. I like the minis. Need to get it out on the table more. It does take too long to setup sometimes.

Nice amount of depth, tactics to the fun of running around smashing each other and punting arrows at each other. Is in the wiz wars category with no hidden information, benefit from knowing the cards etc, runs long if you play on the harder settings, but this isn't so bad as the games set up can take as long as playing does. Almost inverts my opinion - it's some set up, but as it is this game covered a few bases in my collection. I'd play it with two, but obviously better with more. 

Oh and stand alone play is fun, campaign is very good, you get the pleasure of progress without and inordinate increase in cognitive burden.

We only played a single session, but I have a feeling that this game becomes something better when you tackle it in the campaign setting.  When I get a chance to try that, my rating is likely to go up (unless it gets ridiculously silly).  Some rules could use some tweaking, but otherwise, there's good, light fun right out of the box especially for people that like to bop their friends over the head.

===========
Update 9/21/15

This game is [i]definitely[/i] much better when you play through a campaign.  It's relatively short and won't take too much of your time, so it's not a commitment thing.  What it adds is a little progression as you will draft equipment and upgrades in between missions.  This gives players a good sense of purpose even if in the end, the ultimate victory condition is shallow - while the campaign adds the upgrades (meaning you should be going after coins each outing, so you can afford stuff), it seems a little odd that the only thing that actually counts is who wins the final mission.  Everything leading up to that will give you advantages, but are ultimately meaningless unless it means you can't possibly complete the final mission - something that only a truly terrible player will have to deal with.

Upped to a 7"

There are a lot of really raucous and inventive things you can do with the cards and character abilities - the dice just sometimes say otherwise.

A combination of poor dice rolls, sniped kills, end of mission economic disparity, poor curse draws, poor equipment drafts, and the game running too long due to the PvP bogging everything down can lead to a really frustrating experience."

It's a ton of fun and the first few scenarios play really fast. However, later scenarios use basically all of the material in the box, so they do not only take some time to set up, but also to play.

We normally play this as the first game on our game night and I set it up in advance to save some time since it can take around 20 minutes, even when you know the game and have a pretty good ordering system as there are a lot of pieces.

Even so, I wish I could get this to the table more often, but if you want to play the campaign (which is where this game really shines) you need to have the exact same people every time, which is difficult for me to pull off."
431,Ender02,8.5,"My favorite game currently.  I love the idea that multiple guilds are competing to take on the dungeon and be the first to get the treasure.  The PvP + PvE aspects of the game are nice and very easy to customize to your playgroup.  The Campaign is good and has several branches in it that allow for multiple plays without needing to repeat missions.  The game comes with 12 characters that you make your guild of 3 from, and there are countless others available to buy separately that will add more variety to your games.

The campaign that comes with it is a bit short, but has branching paths with multiple scenarios that you can play through a few times before they become repetitive.  Luckily swapping out the characters in your team can make it feel like a new game each play through.

The game addresses that partially, in that there's no quest reward for subsequent kills of that player.  However, there IS gold as reward, which is more useful as it buys stuff.   

When we have to change our behaviour from ""play to win"" to ""play so that so-and-so doesn't flip the table, even though that means you'll lose"",  there's an issue (one I'm generally happy to put up with if the game is great fun).
 
I found the game-controlled mobs more interesting, generally.

Nice, colourful, pretty simple to teach.  with clear rules about line of sight and mob guard reactions and counter attacks.  A fair bit of setup.  Think I might prefer the pure co-op of, say, Gears of War for a quick blast, and team-play of SW Imperial Trooper if we're going to spend multiple sessions on the game."

This is designed to be played as part of a campaign, so our games were relatively easy (as they're designed to be the tutorial missions of the campaign). But play was relatively fun, easy to learn & I could definitely see this being a fun campaign game if played with the right people. Enjoyed it. Will definitely play again.

477,Fluttershy31,9,"Really fun little game. Reminds me of maybe old final fantasy games for the older consoles. My husband REALLY enjoyed this. I think it was the combination of light game tactics, minis and scenario  based game play that drew him in. I thought maybe he would be turned off by the cute nature of the heroes and artwork, but he ended up being charmed by it. I thought this played great at 2, but I would imagine having a higher player count would only add to the fun. Cant wait to play this again!!

Edit 1/20: Played this game again recently, and happy to report still REALLY enjoy this one. Funny, the first few times we played this, I found it tricky to grasp the rules....this last session, I only had to reference the rules a couple times. Which was SO NICE! so REFRESHING!! I could see some folks being turned off by the chibi artwork...I agree, not my favorite either....but, Somehow it works here....Adds to the final fantasy vibe. Im happy to report my rating is holding strong at a 9. my only concern now is we are nearly done with our campaign....now what?! yikes, seems intimidating!"

After a few family play-throughs (3 people), we played almost the complete game through.  Spike character really over-powered.  Family likes a lot.  I want to play through the whole game again, but with some dampeners (or leave out) Spike as an option.

By-the-way, Love the Game Background Introduction!  Nice, and comical story-line."
509,GaelMaverick,8,"Arcadia Quest is a PvP as good as you can get, with skirmished battles packing some of the most lovely miniatures you will ever saw.
The game is competitive, a lot, where each player chooses a team of 3 characters who will dispute the goals with the other teams: the one who completes a certain number of goals first wins the game.

 The rules in general are quite simple, on your turn you choose one of your characters, being able to move and / or make an attack. When attacking, you use one of your character's equipment (swords, bows, spells, etc.) and place a marker on the equipment, indicating that it can no longer be used until your team rests. This is the other option for your turn: when you rest you do nothing, but all the equipment of all your characters can be used again. And the game goes on like this, with each player activating one of his characters (or resting), and passing the turn to the next player. Combats are resolved with attack dice rolls against defense dice rolls. The attacker deals an amount of damage equal to the difference in these rolls, killing the defender if he runs out of life. The variety of equipments, mechanics like the characters respawn after dieing, the creatures battles, calcutalting your movements and the possibility of betrayal attacks (not to say the must of it) sumed up with the difference goals to the victory gives the game a good tactical aspect, easy to learn, not so much to master.

Arcadia is a full plate for fans of dungeon crawlers and medieval fantasy in general. Each game you will be able to play a different scenario, with board setup, monsters and your own objectives, in addition to being able to play these scenarios in sequence in the form of a campaign collecting more and more equipments. To sum up a simple and functional game and, mainly, fun, that only gets better and better with its expansions."

We will see about staying power with this.  I have a feeling I have too many of the expansions and may get tired of this over time, but at least the kids can beat each other up while playing it.

531,Gizmoxxy,8,"I love this game. It has theme and it's light enough to introduce new players easily. The campaign style makes it so there is plenty of replayability. It's neat to build up the characters with gear, and the death curses only make it that much more challenging and unique. The figures are top quality and probably my favorite to paint so far. 

My only real complaints? The figures tend to have thin connectors so I am worried they might break over time. Definitely recommend foam storage!  Lastly, their faces.. they all tend to have the same kind of RAWR mouth open expression. Lastly, this is not a good game for people that have dice hating them. Poor Scarlet died miserably with no hits to 3 hits (plus 5 crits) on my first turn in the game ever."

545,GorillaGrody,8,"The bad news is that it's swingy, and that from scenario to scenario certain players can really pull ahead of the pack.

The good news is everything else. Basically, trying to turn classic RPGs into board games is a losing venture, typically shedding what's special about the two genres while adding a lot of stuff neither genre needs. Arcadia Quest solves this by unabashedly being a board game, and has more spiritually in common with Wiz-War than with Descent. I'd have a hard time going back to the latter.

Quick note: Chibis creep me out in a way that I think can be encompassed by the phrase, ""five year old girl with big tits."" Of which there are a few in this game. Add to this some pretty overtly Christian overtones (one of the wizards is holding a bible) and you have what amounts to a sour political aftertaste, one which I have chosen to ignore for the sake of a good time.

562,guzforster,8,"This is just my kind of game. RPG, modular boards and everybody against everybody. The mechanics are really interesting. I personally like how the monsters behave - at first I thought it was a drag that the monsters were ""passive"" agents but once you start playing it, the monster mechanic is really smart.

Miniature quality is superb. You can see all the characters details.

One small down side is that the games can be really short with two players, and the upgrade phase and setup to the next scenario takes a little while to get done. Also, my copy of the game came with almost all tiles bend, and they don't unbend too easily."

565,Gyges,6,"It's fast and reasonably diverting, which to be fair not all games of its ilk can boast. I worry though, that the game doesn't suit either campaign or one-off play; for the latter, you're expected to fudge things with respect to character progression, and for the former you're stuck with the same characters in perpetuity (and that seems unfun).
Exacerbating both problems if that each mode requires you to draft, and the cards aren't even balanced enough for those purposes. Heaven help you if you get stuck with weak characters in either mode, but in campaign mode you're especially screwed. The equipment is similarly all over the map, which mars both modes. And if you sanded of all the edges, and managed to limit things so that balance could be preserved, then there's practically no there there. 
As a final gripe, last-hit rewards are dumb."

571,happyjosiah,8,"This is an excellent game combining a zany Wiz-War-style dungeon crawl with a campaign system. Rather than simply controlling one hero, each player will control a team of three, each with different (simple) special abilities, who are drafted at the start of the game. Campaign is something of a misnomer as it is really just a series of a games with slight progression. You could even conceivably play through the whole thing in one session. In a four-player game with the base set, every character will be used. Obviously the variety afforded by expansions with new heroes and monsters is quite welcome. It's a rather expensive game, and the chibi-style figures may not appeal to everyone, but there's no doubt this is a high-quality product. "

My wife is really good at figuring out good complementary characters by reading the cards; I tend to go for individual abilities I really like but may not synergize well.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

In general Cool Mini or Not games are gorgeous and very well produced, however I have found that most of their games fell flat for me so my desire to play Arcadia Quest was very low. Most of my friends rave about the game so it was only a matter of time before they made me play it. I found the game to be better than expected, but still an ok game for me.

The rules are dead easy and the playtime varies from each scenario. 

As I wrote before, the game is GORGEOUS, the miniatures are very well done and that’s its best strength.

I love campaign games in which you level up your character and that’s the main appeal for me here, I will even play a whole a campaign to see if the game improves for me. On the other hand, I almost always dislike PvP games because they feel unfair (all against the current leader or the weakest person) and Arcadia Quest is no exception. What I liked about the game is that it isn’t all about PvP, you need to get other things done other than attack your friends and that’s why I can enjoy the game.

Some of the characters feel unbalanced BUT this doesn’t bothers me as much because you have a team of characters and the equipment can change the stats dramatically. 

The gameplay is a bit shallow and repetitive with obvious decisions most of the time. The fun comes from seeing what happens when you attack a monster or friend.

It has a high luck factor (a negative for me in a game of this length), I won the last game because I rolled lots of shields in 9 consecutive attacks (all against the leader), so I won purely by luck. If a player fails to kill a target but leave him wounded all other players will try to attack that target (the weakest player). The equipment can change this point but I feel tactics take a second seat behind luck on Arcadia Quest.

Bottom line, Arcadia Quest is an ok game for me. I will play if requested but with some reluctance. I won’t buy it. It is a great game for many of my friends but not my kind of game.

697,jollypirate,5,"First play impressions: it seems like  a hybrid between Wizwar and a more tactical combat game. Not sure if it's not doing it really well, or if I'm not the target audience for that sort of game (I love Wizwar, and like Memoir)."
698,JonBen,4,"I like this more than I had expected to. It is a very streamlined tactical combat game with leveling and a campaign system. It isn't breaking new ground by any means. However, it is a unique mix of mechanics and they are woven together very well. The rules are clear and there are just enough of them to hold the game together, there is no bloat here.

[b]What I liked:[/b]
-Elegant rules and clear goals
-Quick playtime that doesn't get bogged down
-Fun combos
-PvP combat is often not in your best interest, and players are incentivized to spread their attacks around.
-Exploding 6's mean that there is always a chance you can get off the attack you want, or the defense you need. This adds a lot of dramatic moments.

[b]What I disliked:[/b]
-Random! The dice, of course, but it's not limited to that, I actually think they handled the dice well. It's more the multi-player chaos. For example, when a wounded character is ripe for the picking. Since killing them is one third of the points needed to win this can be a huge boon to the person who is next in turn order after the character is injured.

-You often have little you can do on a turn. Goals are not easy to accomplish, and attempting one will often leave it easier for the next player to accomplish. Additionally, leaving yourself in a vulnerable position is very bad. This means you are likely to have a few turns where you accomplished very little. Or possibly a few where you helped others more than yourself.

-Some of the equipment cards are terrible. A card has to at least earn it's slot, with only 4 slots per character each card must be good enough to justify its place and there are a handful of cheap equipment cards that cannot do this. Sure they cost almost no coins, but they consume 1 slot which is an incredibly valuable resource so they need to be better.

-Keeping the same characters for the entire campaign is boring. Swapping one out after each game would be nice. There are a lot of characters, and campaigns are long (~10 hours), so seeing more characters would have been welcome.

-The tactical/strategic thinking in the game is hampered considerably by the random elements.

-The game is a race to 3 points, obtaining the third point ends the round immediately and there is no compensation for going last. The earlier you are in turn order the better off you are, it is blatantly obvious and the game does nothing to deal with this. Results are not extremely lopsided only because the random elements help to washout this bias. 

-Being the first one to attack a big baddie is often bad. You don't have a good chance to kill them and you simply set them up for someone else. This can create really awkward situations where nobody wants to act first.

-Winning the campaign is oddly ambiguous. Perhaps an attempt to keep all the players engaged in the outcome. 

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]
I can see the appeal, especially if you like direct player conflict in your games. The quick playtime is nice and takes the edge off of the random elements. There is a high fun factor if you play with the right group. It's probably the best game I've ever played in the genre, but with a few major drawbacks for me. I think a rework of the game as a coop would appeal to me more."

Can pull it out on a whim if I have 45-90 minutes to spare, although, it should go much quicker if players are 8 and older.

Too complex for my 4 year old which I cannot get to sit still yet ;-) Seeing that the suggested age is 14+ this is a given :-)

Wonderful game for our Dads & Sons game group.   Perceived strengths/weaknesses in character abilities get balanced by equipment upgrades and scenario situations.

760,Keymaster of Gozer,7,"Same problem as all Ameritrash games: you can roll a whole handful of dice and totally whiff. Don't have to be a ludologist to know that feels lousy. If you think the fact that, conversely, some rolls are replete with crits and exploding dice, which feels good, sure, that's true. However, the human brain registers those whiffs far more acutely than the big successes, so on balance, you end up feeling like a failure. I'll never understand how that is a winning formula for any board game. All that said, chibi figs are cute, and at least it's pretty short, which puts it head and shoulders above most games of its ilk."

It can sometimes be swingy with the dice, resulting in some frustrating moments. But the exploding dice mechanic always keeps you in the hunt. 

My wife and I have mainly played this as a two player game. We have modified it so that we have to still complete three objectives instead of two because the games were ending too soon.

Edited 9/19/2016: I am cooling on this one a bit. This game can be really frustrating at the two-player count. If one person rolls badly a few times, the other has a clear road to domination. "

777,KinslayeR,9,"Arcadia Quest

Хочу познайомити вас з однією з улюблених іграшок в моїй колекції: Arcadia Quest.
В даній грі кожен гравець представляє гільдію з 3х героїв та навипередки з іншими гільдіями намагається перемогти злого Лорда Фанга з його приспішниками, паралельно нахапавши побільше бабла собі та накидавши побільше западла гільдіям суперників.
Фактично гра розрахована на проходження міні-кампанії з 6ти місій з прокачкою персонажів та мобів між ними. Можна і просто пройти одиничну місію, але тоді втрачається сенс в золотих монетах за вбивство монстрів та гільдійців суперників, а також в прокляттях за смерть ваших персонажів. Тому особисто я рекомендую все таки виділяти час і грати кампанію. Благо кожна місія легко проходиться за годинку.
Сам же ігролад доволі простий: в свій хід ви або обираєте і ативуєте одного зі своїх персонажів (можна того ж самого щоходу), або відпочиваєте. Якщо активуєте персонажа, то він може пройти певну відстань по карті та здійснити атаку чи підняти по дорозі якісь ніштяки або відкрити двері. Всі атаки здійснюються кастомними шестигранними кубиками, кількість яких визначається зброєю, яку використовує для атаки ваш персонаж. Також зброя задає символ на грані кубика, який зараховується як попадання. При атаці на зброю кладенться спец жетон, щоб відмітити, що до відпочинку цей герой уже не може її використовувати. Ціль же атаки після підрахунку попадань кидає кубики на захист і віднімає від суми попадань кількість викинутих на кубиках щитків. Все, що лишилось, зараховуються цілі, як рани. Якщо кількість ран перевищує рівень життя персонажа, то він непритомніє. Монстри ж в такому випажку забираються з поля і атакуючий отримує нагороду в вигдялі золотих монет, або цінного луту з деяких мобів. Якщо ж ви вибрали відпочинок, то всі ваші непритомні персонажі відновлюють свій рівень життя на повертаються на поле бою. Також з карток зброї скидаються всі жетони і ці картки знов можна використовувати для атак.
Отак хід за ходом гравці наминають один одному боки, доки хтось один не виконає 3 квести. Варто відзначити, що всі квести в грі діляться на 2 види: ПвЕ і ПвП. Перші - це різноманітні 'збери певні жетони', 'завали моба', 'пробіжи в таку-то локацію' і т.п. Другі ж зводяться до вбивства персонажів з ворожих гільдій. Для виграшу з трьох квестів один обовязково мусить бути типу ПвЕ, тому просто викошувати інших гравців не завжди вигідно, треба і монстрам приділити трошки уваги.
Як я уже згадував вище, між місіями гравці докуповують новий шмот за зароблене в місії золото, а дехто й отримує різноманітні прокляття за смерть свої персонажів. Це може бути, як блок слоту під зброю на наступну місію, так і зменшене стартове здоровя.
Окремо хочеться згадати компоненти гри. Тут CMON не зрадили собі і щедро насипали в коробку мініатюр та картону. Тайли карти хорошої якості з яркими артами, картки з цупкого картону. Мініатюрки же - просто шик. Стьобна фентезі-чібі стилістика з купою відсилок: тут вам і Леголас, і Лерой Дженкінс, і лицарі з піромантом Бобом та кроликом-людожером з Монті Пайтона, і король Леонідас, і навіть Девід Боуї в роді Короля Гоблінів. Такі мініатюри просто просяться в покрас. А враховуючи їх розмір і деталізацію - це чудовий плацдарм на повчитись 'макати міньки в фарбу'. А ще можна замінити картонні жетони на офіційні пластикові, а монети навіть на металеві. І в кращих традиціях CMON гра поставляється з пластиковими органайзерами для мініатюрок, щоб нічого не розліталось по коробці.
Підсумовуючи, перед нами фановий амерітреш в милій чібі-стилістиці з кастомізованими мапами та цілою горою крутих мініатюрок в кращих традиціях широковідомої в вузьких колах компанії CMON. Однозначно 10/10: Завжди отримую задоволення від гри в неї."
778,Kiristo,8,"Arcadia Quest is a lot of fun.  The variety in character skills and the upgrades to your characters in the form of items are the best part about Arcadia Quest. The game works well as a competitive and at times semi-coop game.  Fighting each other, while still having to achieve PvE goals (and not being rewarded with coin for killing the same team more than once per scenario) makes the game feel focused.  Upgrades feel great.  The reward after a scenario, even if you did poorly, feels good.  There are always cheap, but still powerful items that you'll want to pick up even if you didn't get much gold during a scenario, while you might also be tempted to hate draft some expensive items to keep them from the guy who did really well that round.  The game is fairly simple -easy enough to play with children, but still meaty enough for a group of more hardcore gamers.  

 Some of the later items can extend the game by a bit too much (mainly items with re-rolls).  The first 3 scenarios of a 6 scenario campaign are usually incredibly fun, whilst the remaining ones tend to drag on a little longer and not feel quite as fun.  On one hand, it is awesome to get more items and see your power increase by rolling more and more dice.  On the other hand, that means later combat tends to take a lot longer.  The more dice part is great, the main negative is really just the constant and (by the end) high number of re-rolls that take place every time.  Counting the extra dice is fine, but re-rolling a bunch of times while being incredibly powerful and useful, just makes everything take a little too long in the last few scenarios.    

Overall, it's a very fun game.  It perhaps wears out it's welcome a little bit by the end, but the final scenario is still usually a lot of fun, vying for that final blow.  If someone looks like a runaway leader, then you might end up all vs 1 in that scenario, and that has been fun as well.  There are only really two negatives for me, the aforementioned # of re-rolls in later scenarios, and also just the fact that it is campaign-based.  Being campaign-based isn't a problem in itself, but it does mean that playing through the campaign will take ~10 hours or more.  The game does include a good save system and even a one-shot guide.  You could just pick a level and draft items and start out wherever/do one scenario and call that good.  It is a lot of fun seeing your characters upgrade over the course of a campaign though, so that's still the best way to play, just be aware that it'll take along time/several sessions most likely."

Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.

Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.

This is a very short, simplistic, but competitive dungeon crawl where the first to reach three goals wins/ends the scenario. This can lead to the rich becoming richer if everyone else doesn't gang up on the leader in the campaign.

We tend to gravitate to games where we are working together instead of on your own..."
818,lastalchemist,8,"[u]Comments:[/u]
This is probably one of the games I am most grateful that I got in on the Kickstarter for. While I am not a fan of Kickstarter's that have a lot of promotional items just in the Kickstarter, I am also glad that I was part of this one. The extra heroes really kick this game up a notch. 

Arcadia Quest isn't a thinking game by any means, but you will find yourself thinking about strategy to use on your turn. It's not a complex game, but there are a number of moving parts that you must keep in mind on your turn. This isn't a terribly thematic game, but you will find yourself imagining the action on the board in a theatrical way. AQ really strikes a balance for having so many moving parts. The components are really top notch, and in usual Cool Mini or Not fashion the miniatures are something to behold. I really did wish I knew how to paint. I may even pay someone to paint them for me that's how awesome they are. The graphic design and other components are all really well done and are top notch as well. The campaign system is dropped dead brilliant, along with the upgraded equipment after each mission. Take a dash of [gameid=39463], add a pinch of [gameid=2163], mix in a healthy dose of [gameid=699], and lay on top a good amount of [gameid=69120] and you will basically get Arcadia Quest. All of these games provide the players with an awesome experience as a game, and believe me when I tell you that Arcadia Quest will give you just as an awesome experience when you play it. I'm pretty sure after completing a few campaigns my rating for this will go up.

For a game where the vast majority of your turns boil down to simple ""move here and attack"" actions, the rules can be very fiddly. Variance is fine in a game like this, but when it means barely putting a dent into various minions and bosses with lots of health, it often ends up making combat a chore. And the gameplay loop isn't engaging enough for me to put the energy into the long setup or six-game campaign anymore.

If you do not like direct conflict then this game is not for you, as the objectives force you to kill at least one other player as an objective.

851,Lord_Nathaniel,9,"A great game to play with 3 friends or with my SO. Many negociation and betrayal, but the flow of the game is really fine. Our main problem is to gather to do a single-shot campaign, but the fun and enjoyment really are valuable."
852,LostnFound,7,"Awesome:  Quality and detail of miniatures is amazing!  I can't wait to get these painted.
Good:  Gameplay provides good choices in playstyle, equipment and strategy.
Bad:  Watch out for pvp temper flares! (if that's an issue in your group).  High price of expanded set heroes.  We use all powers, but don't get the minis.
Ugly:  Hero powers are unbalanced.  Wisp can singlehandedly win many scenarios because he avoids masses of baddies while others must slog through.  Unbalance is the main reason this is not rated higher.  We overcame this by printing out cards from the CMON website and using powers from minis that we don't own.  So that others can use Wisp's power without using that character.  

Overall:  Our family had a great time playing this game!  We completed two full campaigns and had fun each scenario.  Some scenarios had tense back and forth action trying to get objectives and tension waiting for that exploding critical role.  We will definitely complete more campaigns and make our own scenarios.  
Having said that, the team with Wisp won 80% of our scenarios... He can breeze through and get to objectives while other teams are still wading through goblins and orcs to get there.  If I buy a game at these prices, I don't want to have to work to get it balanced.  
I will get in on the next Kickstarter so as to avoid skyrocketing prices for the exclusives.  Graciously, CMON has allowed the use of the power card graphics, so we can use the powers without going broke."

-Quick campaign: Normally, campaigns can be hard to keep going, if something comes up in real life.  Since this is only 6 missions, it's pretty easy to cram into a short time period, if necessary.  Plus, it leaves you wanting to play more after its over instead of thinking it's finally done.
-Simple rules: Although, when/how monsters attack too a little bit to wrap my head around.  Felt like I spent a little too much time with that instead of the actual tactics of the game in the beginning, but it gets better with experience.

Even as seasoned board gamers and after 4 plays, my group still have to discuss elemental rules and how they interfere with various items, abilities and monsters every time. 

And the items is extremely unbalanced, so getting gold between scenarios doesn't matter that much, because some of the best items are free, you just need luck to get them. At this moment, I don't care about winning or losing the scenarios, because I just want it overwith each time.

Ridiculously fun game.  Really shines at 4 players.  Lot of diabolical revenge moments.  However, these are very tongue-in-cheek and all in good fun - this isn't a malicious game.  The game is light enough to teach to even new gamers, and is exciting enough even for those who like heavier games.

Action can be tense, and dying isn't the end of the world.  There isn't as much of a risk of runaway leader here.  Great game overall.

Not much player interaction at 2-player (at least in the first few missions).  Probably due to the lack of ""kill _color_"" card.  Might try playing 2-player with multiplayer rules.

Update 3/10/16.  Rating dropped from 9.5 to 8.  Not a big drop, but it has lost some points due to setup time.  It's hard to get out to play.  After playing 4p, I'm not sure we want to make a real effort to play 2p.  It's so much more tense and fun at 4p!!

---
Update 4/12/16.  Finally made good headway through the 2p campaign.  The escalation and sense of building characters is amazing.  The narrative is somewhat there, but not on the level of Heirs of Blood.  Still a great game at 2p, with lots of WOW moments.    But in the end, it is... a dice game.

939,Meadweizer,9,"Good:
There are a lot of tense moments when you are trying to roll a hit or defense as well as a lot of strategy in drafting characters, equipment, and deciding how you will accomplish the objectives while hindering your foes from completing them. For me this balance of luck and strategy is what makes the game extremely re-playable. 

The rules aren't too complex and the games end up with a lot of humorous bolstering, there are post game tales about the backstabbing/lucky kills, and there is a pretty good sense of satisfaction when you are able to pull off a win.

The high-quality components is icing on the cake, which makes this a game I would recommend to folks interested in competitive dungeon crawl style games. 

Bad:
It takes a while to set up a scenario. One game took longer to set everything up than it did for the game to finish. It does become quicker the more you play though.

I prefer playing this game as a campaign for building a group up instead of by one-off scenario. This makes it less likely to be played when not in a consistent game group. 

There are a lot of extras for this game and if you end up enjoying the game you will likely want them all. Unfortunately, many extras were kickstarter exclusives so are way over priced.

Characters are unbalanced, so you need to know this when going into a draft and be familiar with a variety of characters. This means new players can select an underdog team if you allow them to. When teaching the game I usually don't partake in the draft and provide insight on character's strengths and weaknesses. "

978,Monteblanc988,8.5,"NOTE: This is for a retail copy of the game without any of the Kickstarter exclusives.

Arcadia Quest is so much fun! The rulebook looks big and intimidating, but its mostly pictures and fluff, so the game is fun to play and easy to teach. Arcadia Quest is a great entry-point into getting other players together for a campaign-style game. However, unlike many other campaign games like Descent or Imperial Assault that are all-against-one or fully cooperative, this game is purely player-vs-player, and even has PVP specific quests to accomplish in order to win the game. When teaching the game to new players, it is very important to reiterate this point with them so no one feels ""betrayed"" because someone stole their kill or even killed them. 

The game can be quite random as all attacks are dependent on dice rolls, but the game is typically quick enough that it doesn't bother me. I can, however, understand that it isn't for everyone because of the luck aspect associated with these dice rolls. Often times, players may get screwed because someone else was able to land the final blow on a monster that you have been scratching away at, or your heavily-geared hero may be killed by another players scrub because of some lucky dice rolls. That stuff doesn't bother me much, and the ridiculousness of the game propels this game towards the top of my list of my favorite games. "

986,mrknickerbocker,8,"cutthroat chibi dungeon madness.

one of the most chaotic and fun plays out there. a campaign like no other, your team rolls their ways through 6 of 11 episodes trying to slay monsters and opposing teams alike (and are rewarded for doing so). each episode you can upgrade your weapons and items in an attempt to get a leg up on your enemies, which is every unit on the board. the board itself is modular, so no two episodes will look the same in a campaign, plus three variable heroes per team and a bunch of weapons/items makes for tons of replayability.

HEY! LISTEN!
as most of the game is based on dice rolls (attacking/defending/items), you can expect a high degree of unpredictability. strategize all you want, but at the end of the day you are at the mercy of the dice in your hand."

Es gibt keinen Overlord, die Monster agieren völlig automatisch. Jeder Spieler steuert die Geschicke seiner eigenen kleinen Heldengruppe, auf der Suche nach Ruhm, Ehre und vor allem Loot. Da kann es auch passieren, dass man den Helden eines Mitspielers über den sprichwörtlichen Jordan schickt.

El tema aquí es que las reglas son simples, la forma como los jugadores van haciendo crecer a sus personas lo es igual, y sientes como tu personaje se va volviendo más poderoso a punta de ítems. La temática es de las más lindas que hay, ese diseño chibi japonés, hace que todo se sienta tan ligero, pero al momento de jugar! a ver si te escapas de que los demás jugadores no te quieran cortar en pedacitos!

1049,Nolzen,9,"Let's get one thing straight from the get go: ARCADIA QUEST IS NOT A DUNGEON CRAWLER! PERIOD! Not even kind of a dungeon crawler. If you go into it thinking that it is, then you will be disappointed!

It's a skirmish arena game where your team has to accomplish some kind of mission while other teams are trying to screw you over. That's it. There's no real looting or scavenging in the game other than treasure and potions you can find here and there. 

That saying, it's an amazingly fun game if you go into it knowing this. Especially if your gaming group is willing to play the campaign where it really shines because of the upgrades you can do in between quests. There's a lot of ""dammit!"" and ""oh, you did not just do that"" moments in the game when you screw each other over. It's lovely. 

People who will like it: People who like in your face games and funny cartoony fantasy and dice rolling.

People who won't like it: People who hate dice rolling or are expecting a dungeon crawl."

1051,NOOCX,8,"Arcadia Quest, what an emotional game. Some of my friends just hate it and my feelings during my first 2 player game have not been that different.

In my opinion the 2 player game according to the rules does not play too well, the quest system feels unbalanced and sometimes rounds are shorter than the setup. Fortunately this can be tweaked by making both main quests mandatory. Generally not all rules feel intuitive (especially the monster movement rules are clumsy) and the rulebook only does a soso job explaining them. The components people are raving about are good and lovely, yet the setting is generic fantasy chibis, which fits the game somewhat well, but unfortunately fails to excite me. Story is blah. 

On the other hand the whole game concept of a skirmish everything goes arena moshpit is just silly good dice-rolling fun. It's not a Co-op, so no reason to play it like that. Take  Arcadia Quest easy as the random, unfair game it is, draft deadly combos, laugh about your fails and even more about the annihilation of your enemies (""4 crits in row with one die, wtf!"" - true story). It's King of Tokyo in BIG, and I like KoT. Furthermore there is a cool character progression system and an enjoyable campaign mode, even if I've not managed yet to play a full campaign. So after several plays with 4 players, I've come to a point, where I really appreciate Arcadia Quest.

Do I think the game is very good in terms of game design? No, it's decent at best. Do I enjoy it and would want to play again? Yes, a full campaign of it! "

The gameplay is simple, but I actually rather like that since the speed and randomness are acceptable levels. The bursts on attacks are really cool, and I like how streamlined it is, especially compared to, say, DnD which is a bit more convoluted.

Plays: 10+

EDIT: After many more plays, I find myself not enjoying or wanting to play as much. I had two sessions semi recently, one with M and P and another session with T and IM that I found a bit more lacking. M commented how swingy it was when she won, and T said the same thing (and T was behind in the beginning). I did always notice this, but it hurts a bit more when my friends point it out. I also find myself less inclined toward Ameritrash, especially when I analyze myself as a gamer and consider my changing feelings toward games. Two of my friends, L and E, have a campaign with me and they ordered Inferno, so I'll probably still keep this for now and maybe test it out with their Inferno set/finish our campaign, and I have another campaign that S and P expressed interest in. IM also expressed sadness/surprise when I mentioned maybe selling it, so I may just keep it for the few friends who enjoy it. But overall, not wanting to play, with the dice rolls (albeit a bit can be mitigated and its meant to be lighthearted fun) being a bit swingy and especially loooong setup time. I'd prefer other euro ish games with fast play and more thinky (as that's the kind of gamer I am)."

Not for family because there are a bit too much rules but it's a nice gateway to more complex games. I like the progression of the heroes. The more the campaign goes on, the more you are attached to your heroes (sometimes they live woes and it's very funny). It's a good idea to always control three heroes because you can combine their abilities to help you in your mission. You roll a lot of dice and it's sometimes dramatic when you think you are strong and you finally loose the fight. The artwork is very attractive and humorous. I highly recommend to take a look at it!"

The rule book is a little bulky but is well written and easy to follow and the campaign is a lot of fun with some great writing and interesting missions.

1. Set up is a BEAR!!!! Can take 15 minutes to set up and then re-check whether anything was missed (I regularly miss a token or monster somewhere on the board).

2. The board is a bit busy. While I appreciate the art, things can easily get lost or can be difficult to focus on. 

3. Rules are fairly easy and very thematic. But thematic rules also mean rules that are easy to miss, forget or misinterpret.

4. Typical for Eric Lang, there is a tendency for balance issues (ganging up, king making, runaway leader, logical elimination, etc.). Eric Lang's way of increasing interaction is to create situations that require players to constantly be vigilant for these balance issues and focus attention on preventing it. If you don't then there will be major balance issues. I find this type of game design can limit the decision space, and make some of the games in the campaign frustrating when one player clearly has much stronger characters."

1084,Orphebus,6,"Fundamentally, it's a Player vs Player skirmish tactic game. Only the player doing the ""coup de grace"" gets the point and there are plenty of teleporters: everybody will be targeting the most wounded players. The modular board doesn't use to be big, you will be able to attack almost any target in a given turn.

That means the game has a very important random component: if the previous player misses several targets leaving them wounded, you will be on your way to victory. The strategic component is almost non-existant and tactic component is very light: you just need to recognize targets of oportunity when available and take them, and trying to make the most of your abilities and items.

The gameflow is quite good, the games are very short and this is very positive for a game that light-hearted. It's been designed to be played as a campaign mode, and while there's also secnarios that can be played separately, I strongly disagree with one rule: these scenarios require the players to complete 3 goals, and the game stops as soon as one player does so, and awards him with 5 extra points; completing these goals can take 5-6 turns, that means in a given round, several players are likely to complete the feat, but only the firs of them will collect the 5 points (usually, you get around 8-11 points). That concedes a huge advantage to the first players, making them much more likely to win and making it impossible for the last player. I usually don't comment rules here, but I found this issue so serious that I felt I should do it.

There are quite a few minis, Chibi style, and the quality of the components and the art is very good. I would say the price, €90, is quite high even for its quality, moreover for a game that light.

1117,pickboy87,6,"This game has everything, dice, tons of minis, new gear, a campaign that's somewhat different every time. So what's not to like? Well, the game is rather simple. You run around whacking monsters and trying to complete a quest. Combat is just chucking dice to see if you hit and them rolling defense dice to cancel your hits. It's also a touch fiddly with the rules as there are a lot of them for such a simple game. Not to mention items only add more rules which are sometimes vague or unclear in spots.

Kind of mindless fun, the campaign is a nice feature, but I worry that the rich get richer in it. Still, it's an enjoyable game. Maybe upon completion of the campaign, my rating will rise, but it's currently at a 6.

Note: I'm really surprised they didn't offer a co-op variation on the game. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to implement. You have to already complete 1 PVE event to win a scenario and there are 2 that are always available. Just adding more difficult or complex ones to complete and maybe buffing certain monsters would have made this something that went from good to great. The PVP aspect is fun, but it gets a bit repetitive."

It'a a campaign style game where each scenario, you find yourself improving upon your guild of three characters.  Each scenario ends when a certain number of quests are completed.  These quests could involve killing monsters or yes... taking out one of your opponents characters.  The coins you receive for such you use to be weapons and upgrades.  Monsters move in response to attacks and characters coming into proximity of them so no GM needed. Quick playtime (~60 minutes) is another plus.  "

1127,pmdf,10,"My favourite game to play with the family (me, wife, 8-year old son and 10-year old daughter), and I think it's their favourite game to play too. My son isn't always keen to play games and gets distracted easily when he does, but Arcadia Quest always keeps his attention and he'll usually want to play again as soon as a scenario is finished. 

It's not a deep game, it's not supposed to be. It's just pure fun. But there's still enough strategy to make it satisfying; enough luck to ensure that anyone can win. 

The campaign is a fantastic experience. Getting better loot to build up your characters is just so enjoyable, and everyone develops a strong connection with the members of their team. We hate having to say goodbye to them at the end of a campaign and pick a new bunch for the next one. But at the same time we also can't wait to draft characters again, with fresh, exciting ideas of who to put together to comprise our next party.

Every now and then, when we have to cooperate to bring down a big enemy in a PvE quest, I get a flashback to old-school World of Warcraft raids. None of the complexity, but all the thrill. It's a special board game that can come close to capturing that feeling, even for a moment.

Arcadia Quest is a competitive game, but it's easy to tone down the competitive aspect if you choose to, which makes it ideal for playing with children. You can focus on PvE quests and even give them a hand when necessary in completing their own quests. Then you can regret your benevolence when they mercilessly stab you in the back to complete their final PvP quest and win the game. Oh yes, I've been there.

That's very, very difficult for a game to achieve. 
The upgrades work really well, it's not just a question of getting stronger with every scenario, while the enemy gets stronger also. The upgrades can make your characters play different.  
Highly recommended for 4 players."

1137,Pops,6,Neat game but I'm not sold on the PvP element of the game. Well done components though - really want to paint this.
1138,Posco,9,CAMPAIGN
1139,Pozman,7,"I wanted to try a different genre, and as Dieter heard some good things about this game, I bought myself a copy. I took some time before I got my copy as the base game seemed not available in Europe for some months.

Played 1 scenario yesterday. Everything was quite straightforward, so turns were very quick and it only took us 40 minutes to complete the scenario. I don't think it will become my favourite genre, therefore the PvP is a bit too high. But off course to fully enjoy this game, you have to play a campaign and Wim and Wouter decided we will play one in the upcoming weeks."
1140,praxil76,8,"First and foremost, I was under the impression that I was certainly paying for eye-candy with this game.  The miniatures were astounding, the tiles were beautiful and the components were well constructed.  I did not expect the game itself to be as good as it is.  Our group has logged in about a dozen games and have had a blast each and every time.  The only real negative that has occurred is due to our gaming group personality.  Half of us enjoy competition while the other half of us prefer cooperative play.  I love the competitive play."
1141,Prequarius,8,"I thought this game wouldn't bring down my super dungeon explore bubble, but it did. I thought the PvP as a great mix as you are not set on fighting only the monsters on the board. Letting your opponents knock off some of their health (or the monster) and then stealing the kills are a nasty way to get on top."
1142,priceisright2293,9,"Very, very fun game. Just simple enough for anyone to get into it, yet has a nice amount of depth thanks to the hero powers and various pieces of equipment.

The game is good mechanically, but there were PVP issues as two players in the second Scenario beat down the player who had won the first scenario and consequently achieved nothing at all. I had a disastrous first Scenario ('tank' dead first dice roll, ended on 3 Gold) but stayed out of trouble in Scenario 2 to get the 'win’. Also, one player opened the door - literally - for the next player to make easy gains… twice! What can you do? "

1161,quietcorn,8,"This is a fun all vs all dungeon crawler game where each player has their own party of three characters. You play a sequence of 6 levels. Each level has a number of quests up, both quests that involve doing something special on the map, and quests that reward you for killing other player's characters. The first to three quest completed is the winner. After each level, players get the opportunity to spend the dollars they gained to buy new equipment which is drafted. I was worried going into this game that the player vs player element would feel too harsh, or that the curses you get after having a character would die would feel too punitive, but that hasn't been the case. In truth both these elements serve to balance the game, and add more strategy in terms of your action choices and targets. I love how in this game, the player to your right controls the monsters during your turn. It turns what could have been an ill-thought out AI into an invested party making the best choices for them, but not for you.

1163,radfordblue,6,"Pretty good overall, but really needs to be played as a campaign with a consistent group to make it fun. The combat system is good, but doesn't feel like enough by itself. I'm not a huge fan of the PVE / PVP mix, which can make the game feel chaotic and swingy. The campaign mode gives longevity and weight to decisions and outcomes in the game, and seems like it would be better. The game also seems to run a bit long and takes a while to set up and tear down."

1167,RainyDays7,6,"I think that this game is a little funky, and I'm willing to give it another shot, because I think it could be fun with a few friends as a regular thing. But the cost of it, the problems with the mechanics (which aren't so severe), and the fact that I'm still pretty miffed at Cool Minis or Not for their general existence, and it's overall a rather passable experience."
1168,rallanking,6,"One-off missions are great - fun, quick, satisfies the dungeon-crawl/monster hunt itch.  Games can end up one-sided, but no big deal with one-off.

The one-sidedness is what causes the lower rating of the game.  If you play the campaign, there are potential game-breaking combos that can make it so one-sided that another player doesn't stand a chance, and the missions become less and less fun.

Would play a one-off game for sure, but I am done with the campaign.  Problem is, I prefer campaigns in games, and it was the entire reason I purchased this game."

1188,ringo84,7,"Very fast-paced skirmish miniature game. I really enjoy that Arcadia quest has quite simple rules and during your turn you only move and attack. I do not like when Ameritrash gets to convoluted and complicated, and at the end the die rolls anyhow decide everything. 

Single scenarios take only little time and during a campaign you can upgrade your heroes' equipment. The heros all have just one special ability and different defense stats, but this is sufficient that they feel different. The drigger mechanism of monsters is simple and works really well. However, I suspect that the prices of the items you may buy are not well balanced.

Of course the miniatures are very nice and I enjoy the cartoonic fantasy setting a lot. I think this game could really be a hit with families, as the basic rules are straightforward and gameplay is swift."

1209,Rookswj,8,"Rating after one full campaign.   Played core campaign plus both Beyond the Grave heroes.
Pros
- Amazing balance between quests for player versus the game scenarios, and player vs player.
- Miniatures are outstanding.  Even if you do not like chili style you will after this.
- Scenarios are well balanced for starting points for all players
- Hero abilities are good, but key in game is ability to level up with items and weapons as game goes along. Gives it enough of the RPG feel.
Cons
-Extremely fidgety and labor intensive to take down and set up new campaigns.
- Some players can take advantage of blocking, and spawning rules if they wanted to really harass someone
- Core game has plenty to keep you entertained for 15-20 hours, but you'll want more heroes to sprinkle in.

Overall this game fit perfectly my group of friends that tried it.  While we were tentative to attack each other at first, the gloves came off quickly.  If you like games where you main mission is to tackle the scenario, but you can help or hurt each other along the way this is a near must.    I was also surprised how much the leveling up of items and weapons really changed things up and everyone took a different strategy.  Yet it felt it stayed balance throughout and no-one got left in the dust.

As for the setup and take down I can only suggest buying or making a better insert. I used Go7Gaming premade Arcadia Quest insert and it is fantastic. Cut the set up time in half, and made organization so so much better from boards, figures, tokens, and cards."

1211,royaldoy,5,"Hugely disappointed with this game. I saw it at Origins 2017 and had heard a lot about Masmorra. I saw this one being played and was enamored by the fact that it had a campaign mode. After playing a few battles of campaign mode I was utterly underwhelmed. For what I expected and then what I played, it was crap. As a fan of games like Descent 1st edition and Gloomhaven, this doesn't even come close. Campaign mode in this game is a joke. You carry over a couple of items....LAME!!!"
1212,rrrrupp,9.5,"Positives: 
Components
Well Designed Scenarios (the kill quests on some are a bit too hard imo though)
The combat system is just fun... you always have a shot and crits make the rolls extremely exciting
Getting new gear is fun
The PvE rewards are really fun. Special gear or titles are both great.

Negatives: 
Rules (Bombs and timing on certain things are unclear)
Item costs seem wrong (grrr at 7 gold)
Rare/Best items may go to same person in drafting
Gold is too easy to get and mostly meaningless
Piggypack on villians doesn't feel great. If you can't one shot a villian, it's typically not wise to attack them and that causes odd situations. To make matters worse, the final quest is to kill a boss who has tons of health."

El modo campaña y la posibilidad de ""salvar"" la partida, es un gran acierto por la satisfacción de ver evolucionar al grupo de héroes.

No me gusta la preparación del escenario, bastante tediosa, y que la finalización de la partida puede ser un poco abrupta.

The design is good enough, but the implementation is a little lacking. Balance issues are abundant and we found it a little too easy to kill low health heroes which usually results in those heroes having negative health penalties on future maps which compounds their easy-to-kill status. Monsters don't attack enough and most maps end up with fewer than half the monsters being killed. 

All that said, the game is fine and would be great for people who want wildly random pvp. YMMV - ours certainly did."

1277,Shimaaji,5.2,"The miniatures look great, the gameplay is nice, but not that special. The fact that half the game was only available to Kickstarter Backers as an excessive amount of Kickstarter Exclusives might have additionally affected my rating.
(I'm a completionist, who sadly likes to support his local game store instead of paying one year in advance for a game made by a company that financially doesn't need such advance payments to create their games and tries to blackmail their customers into still doing exactly that by making half the game kickstarter exclusive.)
To remain on topic though: I find the variety to be severely lacking. Three heroes appear to be stronger than the rest and their 'counters' are Kickstarter exclusive. You can't even play without them because the retail version comes exactly with the minimum number of heroes needed for a four player game. More monsters wouldn't hurt either, but aren't in the retail box.
A rating for the complete game would probably be higher and possibly move the game into the 7.x region for me."

I have no interest in playing the campaign, so only rating this as a one-shot scenario game

I don't know. This game sure looks and sounds like loads of fun, but it seems like it really is just a dice chucker, And most of the focus is on PvE, but the monsters are totally lifeless, yet you have very little incentive to attack the humans, which is where the more interesting tactics would come into play

I've noticed that ALL games that have an option to play as a campaign are significantly worse when not played that way, so I'm sure this is much better if you are going for the campaign.

I'll resist the urge to compare this to Super Dungeon explore, as I think the similarities are entirely superficial, and this is actually more in the vein of a Wiz-War style death match

There was definitely a lack of meaningful descisions and good dice roles seemed too be almost the only thing that mattered. Also, there was not much variety in the monsters and the dungeon seemed almost lifeless, because the monsters only reacted when you attacked them or moved passed them...

That being said, I still love how it condenses most of the elements of a dungeon crawler into a light rule set which manages to not be cooperative and yet also has no one stuck playing an overlord; really, that is the element I truly admire, as I, more and more, find the rest to be sloppy and unsatisfying.

Very detailed unpainted miniatures, two-sided mounted modular boards, custom plastic dice, thick cardboard tokens.  Box is a little small to store all game pieces.

1363,Stormarov45,7,"Interesting.  Lots of high quality minis.

The PVP aspect is neat, but the game requires multiple scenarios to be played in order for the entirety of the game's mechanics to become relevant.

I'd rather have a more complex game for the long haul adventure type game, but this may be better for the young teens.

Also, I'm not all that fond of how the critical hits can explode of to infinity. I think every die should only get to explode once."

I like the concept of fighting against the enemies but also against each other, and the best would be the upgrading charactersbetween missions. But having so much randomness is something I do not like that much for a long competetive game. You could have bad luck with the dice or first decisions and that could lead to disadvantages for the whole campaign.

The heroes and minis are great, and the action/combat system is pretty good.  But the objectives felt off a bit.  The main thing you were trying to do is kill the other people.  But you only get credit for the killing blow, and the average hero takes 2-6 attacks to kill.  So it's like we are all attacking each other, but you mostly just want to attack the guy with low health and hope you get lucky.  And by the way, there are some monsters standing around that you can attack for no reason.

While I was pretty underwhelmed, I do see potential here.  Obviously the game is beautiful, and I think the campaign play would open things up a lot.  We didn't get any new items, so the customization was minimal.  I also really wish this game was cooperative, and I hear there is an expansion to make it so.  Anyway, the jury is still out."

It has a nice mix of chaotic randomness, cute minis and some tactical depth. Everyone can win - while the game still rewards skillful play. There's a bit in it for everyone, which makes it very versatile.
Con: it requires quite some time to set up a game and it takes 6 scenarios. 
It is (almost) impossible to finish a full game in a day.

1417,the bored gamer,7.5,I have yet to find another semicooperative game where the mechansim of semicooperation works just as well as it does in Arcadia Quest. You'll have to (and you know you want to) pound your coplayers but if you exaggerate it you'll be running into danger the whole group will be too weak for later quests. And a single player cannot do it all by himself. There's room for lots of negotiation. Along with the stunning minis plus great hack'n'slay dungeon crawling feel make this a very fun game. However I don't understand why they didn't include different setups for different player counts. It's hardly understandable why you have the same amount of monsters at the same strength no matter how many guilds are involved.

1422,the22dragons,4,"A friend has it.
Great miniatures, but the game is very random, heroes are totally unbalanced, many mechanics are unbalanced too, and its a cutthroat game that encourages you into doing backstabs to other players.

I didn't like it at all."
1423,theaaron,8,"Seems really good so far. There are a lot more rules than I anticipated, and even after reading them you still have to re-check for a number of specific issues that come up during a game. Also, the setup takes quite a bit of time. You have to check the scenario guide and setup the tiles, then put out monsters in specific locations all over the board, put out the spawn points, then set out a number of doors, then put out extra tokens such as quests and treasures.

Other than that, it's fun. The various characters really change up the game. Some of the abilities can seem trivial, but the seem to all have a use. One guy can sneak past enemies without being attacked, making him good for stealing treasure. One guy can attack back after he gets attacked, so he's good to march into enemy territory.

The Player vs. Player combat is interesting because you usually only get credit the first time you kill an opponent's character, so there is little incentive to keep attacking the same player. This seems like a smart design that fixes issues that other free-for-all battle games can have.

Haven't played the campaign yet but it seems to be really well done. Rating could go up or down with more plays."
1424,Thebrewgeek,7,This game really shines when you continue to play with your guild.  I really enjoy getting new items and finishing quests.  The combat is simple but does have quite a good amount of strategy.  The only reason this isn't a perfect 10 is because it takes quite a while to setup and take down.  I would say about 30 min of downtime for setup and take down once you've played a few times.
1425,thecompnerd,7,My 10yr old daughter and I just finished the campaign and we had a lot of fun. We didn't read the winning condition ahead of time and we're disappointed to discover that you win the whole campaign by winning the last quest. We assumed that tallying up the medals at the end of each quest would affect who won. If we play the campaign again we will probably use house rules that others have established for winning the campaign.

They are perfect for certain moments when you want something light or fun but I don't dwell on them. This is definitely one of the best of these type of games.

1455,Tiaden,8,Love the game.
1456,tiagoVIP,6,"[thing=155068][/thing] is a fine game: simple rules and quite easy to understand - it is basically just move and attack, or attack then move. There are choices about who to attack, from where, with which weapon, but, overall, they are easy to make.

The rhythm is accelerated - turns are fast and downtime, even with 4p, doesn't bother. The quality of the components is great - the minis are well done and quite nice, going less for realism and more in the caricature/anime vibe, sometimes not the best choice, but I liked them.

The mechanics include quite a high amount of luck mixed with decisions and preparation - attacks can go wrong in dire moments, even great defenses can fail terribly; there is also the luck when grabbing items around the scenario, in the draft of items to purchase and in the curses, these last two in between scenarios. Still, the game does limits the upperhand of someone lucky by not allowing more than 3 items to be purchased at a time; thus even someone that got everything going on her way in a given scenario, won't truly break the bank.

Furthemore, the mechanics push towards the conflict between players - the Guilds (the teams of 3 heroes each player has) will fight among themselves, as 2 of the 3 goals needed to win a scenario can come from knocking out heroes of other players. Being in the receiving end of this isn't too bad - a simple rest action will make all your fallen heroes to return, maybe even in a better position, with all items ready for action. The problem of being KOed is to drop all carried items/treasures and the chance of receiving a tough curse in the next scenario. Yet, [thing=155068][/thing] is far from being Thunderdome - though fights among players will happen often, the goal isn't exterminated, nor simply battling other will give out a win. Still, the direct conflict is very present, so be warned.

My main issue with [thing=155068][/thing] is the type of chicken category of gameplay. Many bosses or strong enemies won't fall by a single hit, and often is necessary to beat one or more of them in order to reach a goal (or this be the goal). This tends to leave players going ""vulture"" on the others actions, trying to send in an hero in order to seize an opportunity to strike the final blow and get all the glory, even if doing almost nothing of the work. This can also happen by just waiting someone to kill an enemy and just walking past the other hero an reaching the goal spot sooner. And, yes, the situation is - maybe even more - valid to attack heroes that shed took damage; blood in the water will attract the others like insects to a lamp. Therefore, in many moments, players went a ""you go"" state in which no one wants to be the first to attack or advance, simply wanting to wait out to grab an opportunity not created by them. Even the players that want to go and attack, ponder - what if I don't do enough damage, or what if the counter attack hurts me too much? Against some of this there are blocking rules, but not always they will do the trick.

Sadly this gets wort the more we play - a gamer problem not truly in the spirit of a light battle game, I know, but is there and the game not only allows it, it often rewards it. Be aware and think if your group can handle this well.

The replay value is there, with different scenarios and heroes - but with 4 players, you will see all the items and use all heroes.

Overall, [thing=155068][/thing] entertains well - without much commitment nor deep thought (ideally): it is a light game of rolling dice, killing monsters and knocking out the others; with a campaing mode with upgrades coming from the purchase of gear and weapons. If you go for what the game purposes to be, you will be happy. If you simply want more depth and choices, there are better options elsewhere. Know thyself."

These games include 'exclusives' only ever available during the kickstarter campaign. The retail version of their games are generally anaemic affairs where the game is very much stripped down the bare minimum. So purchase of expansions or exclusives via ebay or BGG are necessary to add some options and replayability. I've got a kickstarter copy of this game.

I am already excited to start a new campaign with new characters; either using all the scenarios we skipped on our first campaign, or the Beyond the Grave campaign.  So far, we have played 2-players and 3-players, which seem to be played two different ways: 2-player campaigns are more of a race to win first.  3-4 player campaigns are also a race, but also feels more head-to-head and competitive.  I feel like 4 players will be the most fun, so I can't wait to start another campaign with another couple to see how that goes."

1493,TyDeL,10,"Each play seems to make me love this game even more than before.

It's a silly romp where that's light on rules and heavy on conflict.  Really it plays like an Arena more than a dungeon crawl.  There's no where to hide and vendettas will grow.  Should be obvious, but if dice frustrate you at all then this game will also.  You have to be okay with odds swinging wildly.  You might roll 5 hits and think you've easily vanquished that hero with one hit point and then he pulls an insane string of defensive ""crits"" and ends up killing you next turn instead.  If you're fine with that and can laugh in the face of your own misfortune, then this game is devilishly fun.  The game is light, but the tactical decisions are there, you have to weigh your choices constantly and look ahead for potential traps for those unsuspecting heroes in other guilds.  Some turns you might just be moving to set up for a future turn, or passing completely to refresh your characters, the game keeps trucking along briskly.  

The charm comes heavily from the video game feel, it's exciting. The production is beautiful, it's all flash and pizzazz and unsuspected thrills.  The whole concept of building up heroes, and gearing up as you play through scenarios that really sells it for me.  Great fun!

I will say that if you just play a random one-off scenario and wrote the game off, you're  missing out.  I'd rate the one-off scenario experience a 7 or so, playing through a campaign is magic."
1494,Tyjenks,9,"I love this game.  It's like a board game version of a PC Action RPG.  There is enough complexity so that it is not just walk around and hit things, but once you get past the learning curve, the game becomes pretty effortless."
1495,tymmaaaay,7,"Also own pets expansion and that will be factored into the rating... when I get around to it.

The base game offers the ability to play one off scenarios and that would be fine for demo purposes but the game only really shines as a campaign with a dedicated group.

I personally feel like three heroes might be one too many and I'm disappointed that the characters can't combo off each other in some way. "

1501,Unitoch,5,"It's kind of surprising that this kind of FPS-style deathmatch gameplay hasn't been ported to board games before, and that the first game to bring it in is a fantasy romp.  Nevertheless, here it is.  This skirmish, attack-first gameplay works well and is quite quickly resolved, but I'm not sure there's much game here.  There's little of interest beyond tactically trying to meet your goals as quickly as possible, and the portals make the board very, very small.  There's an awful lot of luck in this game, and a few die rolls will swing the game.  I get the sense that the campaign game is the real way to play this game, but I don't see that realistically happening for most groups.  On the plus side, the miniatures are truly incredible."

There are so many different ways to win by planning a couple turns ahead.
One issue that I have is that it takes a really long time to finish scenarios, especially towards the end of the campaign. We spent close to 3 hours trying to finish a medium level 2nd tier map."

1511,vejrum,7.5,"Only played a single (easy) scenario and a single round of a second (medium) scenario.

Infinitely better than the awful, neverending Super Dungeon Explore.

First game was like a four/five-way boxing match won on knock-out in the first round. Rush in bash opponents and monsters and after a few rounds someone achieved the required three goals (fx. kill two different opponents and three monsters or close/touch two portals). Lots of dice rolling. Gameplay primarily card drafting to put together your three-character team and equipment and tactical combat.

Good fun - not instantly great like Blood Rage but likely to improve with full campaign play with player/equipment progression and more difficult scenarios.

Good enough to definitely kickstart the new Arcadia Quest: Inferno stand-alone game/expansion - excellent value with all the Kickstarter exclusives; probably also the optional new pets (sidekicks) and dragon (extended end-of-campaign co-op scenario) expansions. Still not decided if to go all in and also get the original base game and the Beyond The Grave expansion for even more heroes and the two additional campaigns.

Very unlikely to go completely mad and get all the optional small, 1-2 figures heroes, monsters and pets packs - there are plenty with just the many Kickstarter exclusives and with the original base game and/or the Beyond The Grave expansion there would more than you would ever need/play."

Also there are too many character and other expansions out there to get them all.

1563,wizpop,8,"The score is subject to change as I have only played the first two scenarios of the campaign but I suspect it will stay about the same. The first scenario was a bit basic but the second one ramped it up a bit and I feel it will only get better (this is reflected in the score of 8/10 though).
The game comes into it's own with the campaign elements of upgrading your heroes and the overall theme is pleasant and enjoyable.

EDIT:
I have now finished the campaign.
I like that if I played another campaign it would be with different quests potentially. I really like the fact that you can make your own quests. I think for those that would spend the time to do this and have a good imagination, the game would seem without limits. It does require a lot of time to do this though. The other neat thing is the ability to upgrade your characters and the strategy of playing to your strengths.
Some negatives are I found the in game items (quest specific ones that you can use as soon as you collect them) to be a little lacklustre though (not the cards, but the tokens). I think more would be better.
Another is more just related to my own thoughts on dungeon crawlers in general. While Arcadia Quest doesn't suffer as much as certain other dungeon crawlers, it still has elements of it being pretty obvious what to do or try at any given moment which is slightly boring but it is just glimpses; the multiplayer competitive nature of the game keeps it from being an issue. It is still streets ahead of other dungeon crawlers I have played (in my opinion) because of that multiplayer nature. Another thing that is more related to some bad experiences I have had with dice and that is the potential for extreme luck swings with dice and tokens to make the game pretty one sided. The random tokens you get mean that it is possible to just keep getting bad things while the other player has gets the all good. But I guess with a game like this you just accept that and hopefully it's not too extreme either way. I guess another negative was (and this may be just a two player thing) that you only needed to complete two quests per scenario. Sometimes this led to the scenario wrapping up very quickly (I guess I feel too quickly) as you could complete both quests in one shot and then scenario over, just like that.
One final thought. I do like the idea of a Dungeon Master variant because one of my favourite mechanics of a dungeon crawler is not being able to see what's on the board until I have line of sight of said thing. More surprises to be had this way."

1586,yesbryn,8,"Good streamlined game system that feels different from  dungeon crawl style games due to the PvP competitive aspect. I like the sense of progression and that the campaign is only 6 games long, you could probably play it in a single sitting if you had the day set aside since the games are relatively short. The set up time is a bit of a beast and sometimes takes longer than the game itself which is the main downside.

Waiting for Inferno to arrive before jumping back in - painted all the core box monsters and some heroes.

Advantages
+ Lots of fun, laughs at 3/4 players
+ Great characterful miniatures
+ Quite simple rules set
+ Fast turns
+ Achievable campaign length
+ Still fun for one off games
+ Entertaining to paint

Disadvantages
- Set up time
- Degenerate combos (poor character balance)
- Loses its appeal at 2 players
- Expansion bloat
- Luck fest
- Art aesthetic and female miniature titties make the game embarrassing to advocate for

If you have a consistent group of four players and like player conflict, this should be on your short list of games to check out! This would be an easy 10 for me except for the player count stipulation.

Each player controls a ""guild"", a team of 3 heroes, in an effort to dominate a scenario by completing 3 objectives first, killing monsters, finding treasures, and stopping the other players from doing the same! Then, the players can take their guilds through multiple scenarios, building them up along the way.

Once you jump the hurdle getting to know the rules, there's a lot of fast-paced mayhem to be had. 

The core box alone is fantastic--don't worry about missing out on the Kickstarter extras! There's plenty of expansion material on the retail market so that you don't have to worry about getting enough variability to keep things from getting dull."
