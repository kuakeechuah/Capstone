0,Aimless,10,Why boardgamegeek allows games to be rated before they are released is beyond me. Here is a 10 to offset the 1's.
1,ajewo,N/A,"Cooperative adventure game with bag building by Eric Lang (Blood Rage, Rising Sun).

Pros:
+ Components (detailed miniatures)
+ ""Legend system"": Cards may change the state of the world. They are put into sleeves that are fixated on the board. When you start your next game, the cards stay on the board.
+ 6 unique characters classes with special abilities. Plenty of equipment to loot and equip. Each class has different paths to upgrade. Characters may retire, become legends and provide boni in future games
+ Players explore the world and encounter different events that give them multiple choices
+ Narrative scenarios
+ Player can move together or split up

Neutrals:
# Language dependent
# Skill check is done by pulling rune tokens from your bag that has to match the symbols of the challenge
# Fighting enemies is done similar with rune tokens from the bag. Runes are drawn one at a time and assign to weapons or special abilities, or armor. If you draw 3 demonic runes, you lose one round of combat. (push your luck)
# Big game box

Similar games:
* Runebound 3rd edition (adventure game, chits driven combat and skill checks, push your luck, cooperative with expansion, choices, scenarios)"

Probably the game will require high $$$ investment to make it really great, but I am sure it will  be worth it.

143,YuriTheBrave,3,"I have wanted to get into Trudvang for some time now.
Paul Bonner's art is simply legendary and Free League's RPG products ale always superb in both quality and also pricing. I was excited to hear about Trudvang Legends and I thought this is something I will gladly put my money on through Kickstarter.

On a closer look though...
There are dozens of kIcKsTaRtEr ExClUsIvE items and a dozen expensive addons to consider, none of which make much sense if you consider how games are usually designed. Every product features a bunch of ""epic scale"" or 28mm miniatures that require painting like it's a miniatures battle game, but it isn't. Some of the miniatures are huge and clutter the game board while there is not much need for them really. The game is played on a world map, so the scale or presentation of things represented by the minis is not a factor for immersion or simulation, the minis do not move on any kind of grid and their exact position or facing isn't a factor, they're simply fancy markers for posh people. This would be fine as is the case with many other games that use minis on a world map, like Chaos in the Old World or War of the Ring, etc., but this is a board game and these should be simply tokens to help you play the game. Instead CMON decided to make these figures a focus. Replacing all of them with cardboard stands or even cards like most games do would drive the price down by about two thirds. Incorporating all of the content that CMON came up with into a single box without the artificial ""eXpAnSiOn"" marketing ploy would drive it down even less, making the game more accessible, affordable and therefore popular. All of this would also be fine if these miniatures were offered as optional purchases for painters and collectors and not a part of the base product, but this is not the case.

Right now buying everything on the Kickstarter and giving in to that Fear Of Missing Out factor would mean putting up about 350$ with expensive shipping of ~50$ on top and requiring me to make additional room hordes of miniatures that simply do not matter for the game itself and half a dozen cardboard boxes. It becomes apparent that this is another case of Kickstarter FOMO whale exploitation ploy. CMON's priority is making large sums of money and not making good games it seems. This has left a disgusting taste in my mouth. I'm sure the core of the game and the stories it can tell are fantastic, but CMON's terrible decisions made me decide that I will not purchase anything related to either Trudvang or CMON."
144,Zenly,N/A,I backed this 2019.
