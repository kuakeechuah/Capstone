It's as beautiful as it is fun. It's not heavy in the rules but immensely strategic. Even if you get behind early on and you think you're done, you can very well end up winning the game if you play right (happened in my game) 
I never bothered ranking games on this site but this one is so awesome that I had to. Get it as soon as you can! It's the kind of game that you don't see time passing by and that will get you thinking the following day about what you could've done differently to do better at the game. I can't wait to play it again!"

7,Abso,5,"Similarly to Blood Rage the game has very little to do with frenetic dice and dudes on a map waging war, which might come as a surprise to some. Instead Rising Sun is a mixture of Shogun and Senji, but does not elevate itself from the two. I'd rather play Senji for the better negotiation and quicker action selection. Negotiation in Rising Sun is too vague and lies (pun!) more on the promises rather than actual goods.
I'd like to see Rising Sun's secret auction war board implemented in better games."
8,Acama,6,"Area control, with the main draw being beautiful minis.  Heavy reliance on table negotiation and alliance making.  Some interesting decisions, the most interesting part of the game is the coin assignment in battles."

18,adamscott,6,"Enjoyed it and would play again.  I still think Chaos in the Old World is Eric Lang's best game though.

After a second play, I think it's too long for what it offers.  I'd pick Dominant Species or A Game of Thrones over this, both of which are somewhat similar and play in about the same time.  I don't think the 90-120 min. play time is accurate (at least my two plays were significantly longer).  It's a game I want to love, but ultimately falls short for me.

+ Has some fun moments.
+ Levelling up through buying cards and using them to enhance your strategy.
+ I like the different faction abilities (and personally don't care if they are balanced or not).
+ The honour system for breaking ties is good.

+- Still not sure about the blind bidding during combat.

- Area control doesn't matter since you only really benefit from winning an area once.
- The diplomacy aspect/alliance system doesn't really work and could probably be removed from the game.
- Significant bash the leader and king-making issues (though perhaps not worse than other similar games).
- Best at higher player counts, but then goes too long with lots of down time and chaos in the game.
- You only get to choose the main action about 4-5 times in the game.
- I dislike the Sepukku/Imperial Poets strategy.
- Way overproduced and overpriced.
- Once everyone has a bunch of cards, it's very difficult to figure out what everyone can do...similar issue in TI3/4."

__________________________________________________________

Première partie à 5 en environ 4 heures, avec mise en place d'une partie du matériel et explication de règles.

Un fois les règles assimilé, ça devient très tactique, entre les alliances, les trahisons et les paris de combat... très sympa à joué. 

On l'a préféré à Bloodrage (du même auteur et dans le même style).

On attends plus que les extensions en français."
23,adwodon,6,"The production on the KS edition is wonderful but the retail edition strongholds should've been plastic.  Were they I probably would've just kept the retail version and got rid of everything else.

As is the game is decent, the negotiation aspects are not really there but I enjoy this style of secret bidding for combat.

Ultimately for me its too long, too expensive (for the essential plastic strongholds) and the cool monsters do not feel cool enough."

27,Aennea,1,"Pasted on theme.   Unbalanced to the point that it's essentially broken.  Feels like the designer cared only about the miniatures  (which are cool looking) but couldn't figure out how to streamline the play of the game so he tacked on negotiation as a mechanic.  So glad I didn't back this game.  Looks like it tanks at the retail level too as that version is incomplete.  I've played a lot of games, many of which have left much to be desired.  However I've never been inspired to rate s game before this one.  Which makes this rating of a ""1"" that much more significant to me.  Ugh.

42,ajewo,8,"Beautiful area control game with Japanese theme. All game mechanisms are elegantly intertwined which makes the game tense and complex in an interesting way, but also a bit hard to grasp on the first sight. The loosely alliances are fun to play, especially because certain players teaming up the whole game is not a dominant strategy like it often happens in other games. The fighting-system is not very thematic but very unique: each player has a hidden screen and bids on different effects, but all resources are open information so that there is no ""memory element"" in the game. The loser of a fight gets all the money from the winner. Above all, there is the honor-system that allows different strategies.

[b]What makes it special?[/b]
* Temporary alliances and negotiation
* Combat system based on bidding on different areas. Loser gets money
* Recruit monsters

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Artwork (beautiful)
+ Theme (unusual Japanese medieval, monsters, gods)
+ Components (a lot of detailed minis and plastic tokens)
+ Slightly asymmetric factions
+ Combat system by bidding
+ Dynamic alliance system with alliance boni. Going solo is still an option.
+ Resolving battle order is very important since players will exchange money to each other from battle to battle. 
+ Honor track breaks ties which is important as well for combat. Battles may impact one's position on the honor track which may influence upcoming battles.
+ Competition for Kami (another area control) for special abilities
+ Season upgrade cards grant special abilities, monsters, or victory points (first come, first serve)
+ Replayability: many different deck of cards that can be exchanged from game to game
+ Rules book and player aid

[b]Neutrals:[/b]
# Language dependent
# Direct player interaction (area control, combat)
# No luck, very strategic. However, you depend on the actions of the other players.
# Set-up takes some time (sorting deck of cards)
# Takes some time to teach
# All expansion content fits tightly into the main box
# Big game box + expansion boxes
# Some faction abilities seem more powerful than others
# Play time quite long especially with high player counts (6 players)

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Unforgiving / Hard to catch-up. Even the first round can be decisive.
- Many miniatures are not essential or have a very low impact to the gameplay (increased price tag).

[b]Similar games:[/b]
* Chaos in the Old World (area control, asymmetric factions, intertwined factions, no alliances but some still some loosely cooperation)
* Cry Havoc (area control, hand management, asymmetric factions, unique combat system, no alliances but factions must balance each other)
* Tsukuyumi: Full Moon Down (area control, asymmetric factions, no luck, card drafting)"
43,AJJRausch,6.5,"Based on first play, with 6 players (KS with almost all the trimmings). Thirty minutes in, there was a clear frontrunner. The next four hours did not change that. Final point scores were 97, 54, 30, and 3 in the 20's."
44,ajpl,8,"I didn't expect this to top Blood Rage but I think it has. The action selection mechanics along with the Tea Ceremony politicking add a really interesting layer to the area control format, and the bidding system is quite elegant. A definite keeper for me!"
45,Akado,3,"Too many moving parts, and balance felt fragile rather than tight.  There are definitely opportunities for clever play, but there are a ton of noob traps that punish inexperienced players.  Also, taking godzilla hostage is silly.

There are lots of cool abilities, cool monsters, and strong creates that you can buy.  And the player who ignores all of them and just buys VP will win.

Don't see a need to play again, don't want to own."
46,AKBanse,5,"After playing the game 3 times I find that there are some issues that leaves me lacking in desire to play this game.

I believe the most egregious of which is a player who only gets one turn getting left out of an alliance in a 5 player game.  2 players will get two actions of their own, the other 2 are most likely allied with the initial double action two so those combos are getting bonuses for 3 actions in that turn while the player left out gets a single action/bonus."
47,AKHawkster,9,"Fantastic area control game with important decisions shaping each game, ranging from who to ally with, what order to perform actions in, and which path to pursue to maximize victory points.  Looking forward to many rounds of this one."
48,akiracrosshair,2,"Good: Very nice artwork. 

Bad: Chaotic gameplay where it is hard do any predictions and tactics. Just like sitting and hoping for the best. You can fall behind really early the game. 1h into the game I know as was going to come last. Large period where i had nothing to do and that is no go for me. 

Summary: Good looking terrible game. Really terrible."
49,Akles,9.2,"Firstly, I haven't played Blood rage, so I'm not able to say which one is the best. Secondly, for the moment I played it three times (5 players, 3 players, 4 players) with casual gamers and hardcore gamers where they really enjoy the game. Thirdly, I think it’s not sufficient to put an exact rating after only 3 plays (I will surely come back to adjust the rating) but to be honest, I will probably not go under 8 of rating (I put 9 for the moment) because: 
- It is the type of the game that I really like: area control, diplomacy, bribery, no dice, action selection, asymmetrical power of the clans, make war :D
- All that I cited works very well (Wow, a cleaver combats systems), with a huge replayability.
- Really good and nice components, especially for all the stuff that you can grab with KS.

To be fair, for the moment what I don’t like in the game, it is the downtime to bring it on the table and to store it in the boxes after the end of the game :/

Edit: after more than 15 plays I will say definitely the most entertainment, strategic and thematic board game that I play"

I find the Kami track quite a compelling decision space, but didn't appreciate the changes to balance that the Kami Unbound expansion brought. The base game with the Dynasty Invasion additions are more than enough game. 

Strangely, though, I think that with all elements taken into account, Cry Havoc might be the better game and provide a similar feel in a shorter time frame. "
88,amiller01,7,"The diplomacy aspect removes the ceiling on play time, making me much less likely to negotiate with players in order to retain my sanity, but there's a lot of game without that, as well. Nevertheless, early players will encounter balance issues and take a long time making their decisions. Climbing the learning curve will iron out people's analysis paralysis and give them the knowledge to counter the most effective strategies. Contrary to most other reviews I've seen, my opinion seems to be *lowering* slightly with subsequent plays, but I'm hoping it'll go back up. It's partly due to a dearth of closely competitive games; someone always pulls way too far ahead. People will say ""git gud"", but no other game I have has had this issue."

No, you can't kidnap THAT figure despite it being a sculpt with a player's colour ring on them because it's a Kami. Serious down time problems abound too.

99,Andy Parsons,8,"Rising Sun does some very Langian things with an area control game.  There are factions that are asymmetric from the start (Chaos in the Old World) and become more so by acquiring cards (Blood Rage).  Area control is front and centre, but it isn't the only way to score points (see corruption in Chaos) and, indeed, killing your own forces can be profitable (Blood Rage).  Areas aren't taken out of play, as they are in those earlier games, but not all will score for control in any given season.  This has the same effect of tightly focusing the action and promoting conflict.  

Rising Sun does add some new elements to the mix: an action selection system that provides players with a limited, random selection; and honour (a tie breaker) that can be gained and lost.   Combat resolution, with its blind bidding on four different things is what really gives this game its distinctive flavour.  It asks some quite euro-gamerly questions about how to extract the most points from any given battle while retaining/gaining the money you need for the next one.  The correct answer is not always to crush the enemy.  I like that Rising Sun continually asks you to look beyond the immediate benefits of a chosen action or bid to its possible impact on others' actions and later events. 

My one criticism of Rising Sun is of its cavalier attitude to making sense.  Why does control of a whole region matter in one season, but not another?  Why are ronin invulnerable in battle?  Why does my money disappear at the end of a season?  Why are those big, fantastically sculpted monsters often a worse choice than a simple bonus point scoring card? More seriously, why, in a four- or five-player game does one player get to select an additional action over the course of the game?

Production quality, even of my measly  retail version, is excellent.   The artwork is distinctive and pleasing.  The rules are very readable, but, as eight pages of the rules forum confirms, they're not all there."

106,Andy_Carter,3,After a great deal of hype and anticipation this game failed to deliver for our group. There is a very disconnected feel throughout with the imbalance of powers evident leading to (in effect) player isolation on the score track. If you’re looking for the control reward element and clan development then stick with blood rage. If you’re looking for a better use of the battle system in a more polished format then go for cry havoc. I’m certain this game will still generate a good buzz but all five in our group were left markedly underwhelmed.

Each faction has multiple paths to victory. Replayability comes from varying card sets, factions, and play styles. The game builds up to a nice, big climax at the end.

I dinged it 2 points because ... A lot of the card texts are not clear. The theme is strongly integrated but not perfectly. The Kami feel underwhelming. They're just extra abilities to be unlocked."
119,anwei,7.3,"I've painted my KS version and have the fancy stuff and a nice printed insert. The combat system is very good, the action selection system is good, the Kami system is good. 

The game just has the absolute worst flow of any game with mostly good things about it. While one player picks an action tile, everyone just sits there. Then everyone starts moving or summoning units, but the dependancies make it hard to plan ahead, so everyone just sits there. So much waiting around. 
This could be better with a more experienced group - I'd love to have my mind changed - but it's not a game I really want to play, for all the nice-ness.
(I also strongly suspect that SG additions like the Kami expansion are trash. Extra monsters are nice, though they rarely shake things up much.)

Yes, there's negotiation and interaction here: but it's all in the little details. It's fuzzier and much less straightforward than Blood Rage, but you're constantly talking and when you're finished you keep realizing all those subtle tactics that you missed. A counterpoint to this: the negotiation/diplomacy aspect is not confrontational or explosive enough to justify the minis/visuals.

[b]Why I love it?[/b]
-A fun asymmetric area control game.
-The order of things adds a lot of strategic depth.
-The game has a lot of subtlety, in all aspects.
-Negotiation and Diplomacy sandbox.

[b]Why it may not be for you?[/b]
-The negotiation and diplomacy layer is very group dependent. You need a group that can handle a certain amount of heat, and that can also cool off afterwards.
-The mechanisms provide a lot of strategic depth in a not obvious way.
-Both mean the game is better off with people that can handle it emotionally and intellectually, and that like this kind of games. Quite a reduced pool.

[b]Starter Kit:[/b]
The KS adds a lot of cards and monsters, although the base game has enough of them. The expansions add also more of the same, and the Kami one adds an extra mechanic layer. I think expansions are not mandatory, but desirable once you want more content.

[b]Comment on Alliances and Spite:[/b]
 I'll just repeat what I've said elsewhere:

""For me, RS is a 'sandbox of intrigue, war and betrayal'. Being a sandbox it means everyone can tune the game as least conflictive as they want, or as most as they want. You could totally ally with your bestie all seasons, or it could be a very bloody war. I mean, I had never seen a certain person very angry, only in this game. In BR, like an angel. I mean, the season appears to be very structured, the tiles appear limited in options, the tile sharing and pastel art looks zen, but that's it. Few games allow you to tailor them as much as you want, but unfortunately for some people, also few are as group dependent. Much like party games, where people need to be in the mood to have fun, in this one, you need your group to be in the mood to royally screw each other.""

""Its potential spite-o-meter is through the roof.""

""I think most people misunderstand alliances in RS. In another thread, too. You don't ally with someone for noble reasons, like sharing or taking down the top player, I mean you can claim that. But all claims are empty and unenforceable, you only ally to get more things out of them while giving the least to your 'ally', prevent them from allying to someone else, get provinces for free without losing troops. Or the best one, be the second from the alliance in turn order, make them play something, then refuse what they asked you to play. Even the name of alliance is misleading. You are not making a friend here, you are merely agreeing to put your tear shaped icons together, then all bets are off. Consider how your clan's powers can totally screw someone... Lotus, anyone? Moving a lot of power across the map in the last turn? You may play like an angel 99% of the game, just to stab them in the back at the last moment, the last tile before the last battle, much like what lovely Brutus did back in the day.""

[b]Player Scaling:[/b]
3p means there is little interaction.
4-5p is the ideal player count.
6p means some monsters become too imbalanced."

132,ArbitraryRanger,10,"This game is tremendous!  As soon as we're done playing, I want to immediately set it up again and play a second time regardless of time of the day."
133,ArborBarber,5,"I can’t say I really get Eric Lang’s game design. This game takes the basic concepts in Diplomacy and adds some interesting bells and whistles; so far so good. The strange part about Rising Sun (and Blood Rage as well) is that the game has these amazing monster models that would seem to be focus of the game, but playing them is almost always strategically bad. Is the whole game a trap? Punish the players that want to do the cool things that they spent all the money on this game to do?"
134,Arboretum,10,"Eric Lang has managed to design just another unique and intelligent game after Blood Rage. In Blood Rage it is possible that a card you chose is never used, an upgrade you decided to have never produces any effect because the gameplay develops in a different way. Here in Rising Sun every little thing you do does have its consequences, everything makes sense; the whole structure of your gameplay is so tight, and can yet be so versatile, that you have a very intense experience. Time flies. 
The one thing this entirely different game has in common with Blood Rage is that there are so many different and creative ways of winning, that very time your game experience will be fresh and exciting.
The rules are complex, at the same time they are fairly easy to grasp.
The artwork is truly beautiful, and just looking at the game and its components is rewarding in itself.
If you like stretegic competitive games, traitor and bidding systems etc., this is for you."
135,arcadebox,6,"Went from 8 to 6.
Odd game, fun to play but dry and does not create any narrative. The negotiation aspect of it is negligible and not fleshed out as much as I expected. It seems that Eric Lang never managed to dish out something deep and interesting like CitOW.
Yes you have to negotiate to stop player getting insanely powerful combos but you do that in so many other games including Blood Rage.
I am keeping it for now as my group likes it, but I have doubts it's going to stick in my collection."

Neat variability and well-integrated concepts, although still falling short of actually being thematic for me. Biggest hiccough is just the pure game length, and I'm pretty sure after a 4P and 5P play that even numbers are way better because of how hosed you get for not being in an alliance. Betrayal just isn't that good of an action. Also kinda funny how the gigantic monsters are often no better than rank-and-file bushi soldiers. I've focused on the negative here, but it's a solid system with great bits and I can see why many love it."

Rising Sun isn't the type of game that's necessarily in my wheelhouse, but it'll get a lot of playing time for sure.  Excellent.  Rating may go up from here depending on how play goes at higher player counts."
165,atomicteaspoon,4,"A game made to sell miniatures, as you'd expect from CMON. You can dismiss my opinion, but Chaos in the Old world was Eric Lang's best game. He continues to make derivative games from his initial success. All the monsters exist for 2 dimensional reasons and make the map hard to examine. For me, this game doesn't have much of a soul."

The game has much more randomness to it, which will not suit everybody i suppose.
But with the randomness comes the variation and you can play many times, it will feel different with each game.
The expansions bring basically more of the same to the game. More Gods, Season Cards, Clans with their unique abilities and new Monsters.

Közben beszéltük, hogy összhatásra Kemet-szerű, talán onnan jött ez, hogy itt is elég hektikusan változnak az erőviszonyok...

The game itself is somewhat of a blender of mechanics. There is a bit of area control, some negotiation, a slice of action selection, variable player powers...
Nothing is revolutionary or even innovative, but chef Lang took known ingredients and mixed them for a tasty recipe: Rising Sun is engaging and lives for its merits as a game, providing a very solid gameplay experience, full of backstabbing, excitement and fun."
208,bazyliszek10000,9,"The game is very nice, but ""alliances"" do not appeal to me. I see a problem playing 5 people, because one is left without alliance and is very lossy. When playing with four people, the alliance is always formed, but it does not bring anything special, since everyone has it anyway. Playing without alliances loses one of the actions you can perform. To sum up, the game forces the creation of artificial alliances, which I do not like (if someone likes to play at the table, probably the feelings will be completely different). Once that he does not want to take part in shallow negotiations, two that if I do not do it, I am deprived of one action and loss for the premium from the alliance. In the stand you feel that something is missing, everything is well counted, so on the border to think about additions, but additions are largely plastic and additional armies that are already sticking out. The cradle lacks really little to get rid of the feeling that something is missing. However, I do not want to keep the game in ""10"" boxes. The monster figurines are too big, and the temples become invisible as the board makes a fuss. The whole is an exaggeration, and the stand leaves nothing to be desired."
209,bbhalla,8,"Initial Impression: This is the first CMON title I've ever Kickstarted and I'm happy that I did. I was concerned that the game might simply be all bling with no gameplay but I'm happy to say that there's definitely a great game to go along with all those wonderfully sculpted models and thick cardboard. This game is being compared to Blood Rage, a game I wasn't particularly wowed by, but I see few similarities. I enjoy the fact that negotiations can be as prominent as the players want, with alliances granting both advantages and disadvantages. The game flows smoothly and is simple to teach but as is with most area control games, the decisions produce subtle results. The war phase should appeal to non-Ameritrashers, as the combat system uses a blind-bidding mechanism which eliminates random forces affecting the results. I suspect that my ratings will go up as I begin to grasp the subtleties of the gameplay. This game has a permanent place in my collection. "

RISING SUN

Wow! This game is fun.
I have played 4 rounds (×3 Bonsai, x1 Lotus)
Tons of things to try.
Asmy metrical clan powers that all seem awesome.
The political mandate selection is superbly integrated into this game (and the KS version  are chunky like an oversized domino).  Player turns are quick all player get to take the manfates basic action and the active player (and alliance partner) receive an additional bonus action. As a result, you are always engaged in decision making even when it is not your turn.
Area control for Kami bonuses/powers.
Training cards are like an ever-evolving  tech-tree and the synergistic benefits between them, clan power, and the proper mandate card chosen at the appropriate time can be game changing.
The battle system is a bidding mini game unto itself and although bribes are not legal during this phase of the game, you can negotiate the outcome of the battle or bluff and back stab what you just negotiated or simply overwhelm your opponents with hired ronin, monsters or with your amassed treasury.  Beware, however that all winning bids go to the losing clan as war reparations.
Oh, and the minis are ok too.
Rising Sun is able to provide players with an immersive game experience that is based on euro mechnics, with fuedal japanese minis, that continuosly offers up thinky, fun decisions at every turn in 2 hrs and under.

I am glad this isnt just a rethemed blood rage and the new elements (action selection with allies sharing an extra benefit all works really well.  The combat to me though falls a bit flat - it lacks the excitment of blood rage and can be a bit of a rock paper scissors type of thing.  Its good, dont want to undersell it but its a blind bidding type of thing and I am coming to the conclusion that I do not like blind bidding even if this is done in a fairly interesting way.  More strategically compelling than blood rage and certainly simpler and more newbie friendly.

This game has all of the good stuff I look for in a game. It's a grand area control game with impressive miniatures and (in my opinion) revolutionary combat mechanics. Cry Havoc feels like a crappy version of this masterpiece mechanic. The order of battles. The hidden bids for the locations. The reparations. Man this game is clever.

My negative would be that I think the Turtle clan should have higher starting honor than the Lotus. Just my opinion. I understand that the clans have balance based on turn order which annoyed me for a while but clever negotiation means none of that matters."

We're all familiar with ""point salads"", right? Rising Sun is the top ranked ""rules salad"" game on BoardGameGeek. The defining characteristic of a rules salad is that it's almost impossible to take an action without a) implementing a new rule or b) activating a rule that has been implemented by another.

You know if you're playing a rules salad because:
- each player has unique rules that apply to their faction
- there are stacks of cards or tiles with new rules that are difficult to read from most seats
- the game is approximate 1/3 downtime due to passing around cards or tiles or reading new rules aloud
- at some point, there are too many new rules in the game to track all of the effects and make informed decisions
- at some point, you make a suboptimal move simply because you forgot one rule
- you'll need to play the game many times to encounter all of the rules and begin to grasp how they balance and interact with one another
- you're pretty sure the game isn't truly balanced because there are too many rule permutations to possibly

I know many people like Rising Sun and I respect those preferences, but my opinion is that Rising Sun is the epitome of everything that's wrong with modern board games. I get that it can be fun if you've got a group you love negotiating with... but there are so many better negotiation or area control games. I get that it's attractive to look at and you're getting a lot of minis, but that's not why I'm in the hobby. For me, I prefer strategy rather than chaos, or thoughtful decisions rather than overwhelming randomness, depth from simplicity rather than complexity.

I enjoyed my first play and this game just keeps falling in my personal rankings every time I play it again. I'm at the point where I'm going to refuse to play it in the future. I'd rather play a brilliant game like El Grande with cubes than a set a of overproduced minis disguised as a game."

242,bhudson1972,8,"I am really impressed with Rising Sun. The base game is outstanding, but when you throw in the KS exclusives and expansions, you have a game that really has a lot of re-playability. There seems to be several paths to victory. The asymmetrical clan powers are very cool and interesting. I was worried about the level of negotiations, but so far, I haven't seen that part of the gameplay really make a huge impact. This definitely takes repeated plays to grasp some of the strategies. Finally, if you do acquire the KS exclusives, then the board presence is off the charts. I'm interested to hear of any two player variant rules, though I realize that defeats the purpose of the negotiation aspects of the game."
243,Big B,9.5,"The successor of Blood Rage that commonalities with that game (dudes on a map where sometimes you can reap vp from losing battles, mythological theme filtered through heavy metal sensibilities) but has a more deliberate, high command level viewpoint that I like. Very much like the blind bidding to change the outcome of battles, like how monsters are permanently part of your forces. Really like how there's advantages to have allies but also not, and there seems to be where the real strategic meat is. It's got a lot of bling but everything looks very nice laid out. Can go long with more players but doesn't  feel any longer than it needs to be. Great game, want to play it more."

247,Bigft64,9,"(June 2018) Sure, it's way overproduced but this is another great Eric Lang game. Area control mixed with strong player powers and a unique battle system. The alliance system and the fact that open trades and negotiation are encouraged make this game shine. The main drawbacks are a)it takes a while to set up and tear down as there's lots of pieces and 2) it's on the longer side running around 2.5 hours or even more. This game also feels like it's meant to play with 5 players as that ensures one player is left out of an alliance. Due to the nature of the game and designer, this will draw comparisons to Blood Rage and you can see parallels in the game play too. For me, this is better than Blood Rage but I like both games.

(January 2020): 8 => 9

1. People see the glittering image, they are right to praise that
2. Components they say yes top notch.

But that maybe gives idk 0,5 of a start to any game for me. The rest is...

It is the only game I have graded with this grade, the only... but it deserves it.
So let's go and look deeper shall we:

1. Replayability is 11/10 yes it is that amazing especially if you have a KS set
2. Decision making - off the chart so many decisions all the time it is ridiculous but they are all good and they seem simple yet they are so complex... 10/10
3. Different path to victory. Absolutely.
a) You have different clans for each you have to use them to the best of your ability
b) Honour will play a big role but you can go either
- Low on it and reap rewards, or high, decision is yours only
c) You want to focus on Kami that an idea, on which Kami there are four? You want to focus on one, two...?
d) Should I save money and win battles and VP with that, should I use it to bribe, should i....

I ll just stop Different paths 10/10

4. Mechanics - Elegant game through and through 10/10
5. Theme - Rich in theme, theme that I love the only part that didnt make sense is being an ally but still take hostage and what not and not breaking alliance.... so here I give it 9.5 / 10 for this...

And so on and on...

Simply amazing beyond belief"
283,Bluesuitv,10,Only wish chinese clans were actually chinese woth chinese monsters but they just feel like more japanese clans that have seperate japanese gods.  Doesnt affect game play just more for theme.  Wish monsters werent neccesarily treated as single bushi some times but I guess thats part of the strategy.  Overall those are my only negative feedbacks but amazing game.
284,bm6262,7.8,Factions are very unbalanced and there isn't enough negotiation to overcome this balance.
285,boardgamesdotEXE,9.5,"While the game is dramatically different from Blood Rage, they are inevitably compared against each other so I want to address that up front. Blood Rage is a game with drafting during which people do actions against each other. Rising Sun is a game of diplomacy where players do actions WITH each other, in order to most benefit themselves. The result of this? Rising Sun is inherently more interactive, and feels like a game where everyone is constantly involved in an ever-changing board state.

The thing I love most about this game is player agency. If you have a bad board position, you can diplomatically move things into your favor. If you have an average one, most of the mandates will give you several options for improving it. If you have a great one, there are mandates to capitalize there, too. The player is constantly in control of their destiny, and no decision is throwaway or obvious. Many games put you in a place of ""fake decisions"" where you may say to yourself ""sure, I CAN do ten different things, but nine of them are horrible"". This is not that game.

From there, the variable clan powers, variable province setup, variable Kamis, and even variable season decks you use to power up your clans add tons of replayability. No two games are remotely similar, and even playing the same clan repeatedly will reveal new strategies based on the game state.

Finally, I would clearly be missing something in my rating if I didn't mention the large collection of highly detailed minis. I think these are CMON's best miniatures to date. The monsters are huge and imposing, and even the little warriors hold great detail. Best of all, they seem to have improved their process so the spears and swords don't end up ""wilted"", or bent in half.

All in all this game is truly exceptional!"

292,BobDodgerBlue,N/A,1402
293,Bobonthecob,9.5,"TL: DR - If you like blood rage at all, and are at least okay with negotiation, you absolutely MUST play this.

Rising Sun, dubbed the spiritual successor to Blood Rage, is a game of alliances, combat, and sudden but inevitable betrayal! 

Turns are taken in this manner: pick an action tile (called mandates) and everyone gets to do its effect, but you (and your ally if you have one) get to do a bonus stronger effect. However, one mandate allows your ally to betray you and break your alliance, while replacing figures on the board with their own. 

Combat is incredibly interesting. You secretly bid your coins to win specific objectives on your personal war tile, and then they occur in order and include options like taking a hostage and committing honorable seppuku. You can even win the last one (War poets) and gain a point for ALL figures that died in that battle, even if your presence was minuscule. You can get a good amount of points without winning the battle, and the kicker is that while you lose any coins you bid, the winner of the battle gives the coins they bid to the other participants. So you can choose to throw a battle and simply gain coins for your next battle to gain better standing.

Each player has an ability that if you didn't know the others, would seem overpowered. The dragonfly clan can summon troops anywhere and move anywhere freely, the turtle clan have their strongholds on the backs of giant turtles, which can move like their figures and count as indestructible troops, the lotus clan can pick a mandate to play face down ad declare any mandate they want!

Last but not least is production, which even without the kickstarter goodies is still excellent. It hurts to say it, but the miniatures are even better than blood rage. The sculpts are amazingly detailed and occasionally monstrous but without feeling fragile. Everything is begging to be painted, and that's a lot of stuff to paint. Honestly my only hangup on the game right now is setup and takedown due to all the miniatures and the CMON typical plastic positions they go in. You'd honestly need to label their spots to easily remember where everything goes, but I'll have a better solution for that as soon as humanly possible.

Honestly, Blood Rage is my favorite game, but it may only take one more play of this to supplant BR. It's that interesting, thematic and fun. AND it does all of this without overwhelming you with options. Play it please!"

295,Bolm,5,"Ultimately, Rising Sun has interesting design ideas that led to fierce boredom in me. So little choice for such a long game is a deal-breaker to me. The table-talk does not make up for it at all"
296,bolton317,5,"too long a game. Tea phase doesn't work well when people make pacts to stay a team for all 3 phases instead of opening themselves up to negotiation (Tea phase has a lot of potential but really depends on the right players). The upgrade cards aren't very interesting and a lot of them are the same. You can work out if you have a chance of winning or not with an hour left of game time as there is barely any end game conditions. The combat bluffing system gets boring after a couple of games.
Would only recommend this game if you have a group of players who all love to negotiate and are 100% impartial"
297,Bond8089,9,"It amazes me how good Eric Lang is at designing area control games.  Has a hint of blood rage in it, but it is a completely different game (and probably more in depth).  Love everything about it and can't wait to play more."

This is the dudes-on-a-map game I've been looking for this whole time. Excellent."
300,BooMie,8,Battle are bluff based and I've found that each game I've played (4 players) has been balanced and engaging and stressful in the best way. I would be interested in seeing how 5 players change the balance and alliance system. This game could be made less expensive without the extremely detailed minis but they do add such a level of luxury to the game that I imagine it's weaved into how invested I am each and every time I play.

312,brazidlo,10,"Rising Sun eliminates most less-than perfect mechanisms within Blood Rage, replacing them with the best mechanics of any game in my collection. There are strong elements of planning, area control, negotiation, and bluffing. If bad things happen in a round, you've been betrayed, out-maneuvered, or manipulated.

We go:
Everybody performs the action selected by the choosing player (Race for the Galaxy, Puerto Rico, ect). This has been keeping everybody engaged and vying for competitive advantage. The honor system, asymmetries, and alliances can make these decisions complex.

Kingmaker:
My only issue with the game is that losing players could likely influence who comes out #1 and #2. This is somewhat offset by the fact that it is likely that the losing players have an ax to grind with #1 or #2."
313,Brazol,7,"KS version with Daimyo Box and Coins

Great dudes on map game. You can tell it's Lang's game as it has some similarities with Blood Rage but it's totally different game. The war phase bidding is perfect. It makes the game hard to predict. Each step in war phase has impact on next steps and even on next battles. The whole game felt a bit random but in a good way. Also after 2 games I feel like the game is balanced because everything is imbalanced :P. There are OP combos possibilities everywhere. Even each clan special power seems too strong. Sometimes it's necessary to combine forces and stop someone from achieving it because it would break the game. 
The Diplomacy comparison is forced in my opinion. The alliances are useful but are part of game mechanic and I don't see a lot of space for negotiations.
A lot of fun.

"
314,brewsaki,8,"What I love about this game:
+ The player powers are very different from one another.
+ The action selection is super fun and a bit like Race for the Galaxy. Everyone gets to do something, but the selector gets a bonus.
+ Bidding during the conflicts is also fun because you really need to choose which conflicts you want to win and which ones you are willing to let go in order the cash the winner's money.
+ As with many other Eric Lang games, everything from the monsters to the upgrade cards feels super powerful.

What I dislike:
- The bidding part can be a bit long if you're not part of the combat.
- The alliance mechanic is a bit underwhelming. I wish it played a bigger part in the game. "

331,burgessshawn1,7,"Personally, the game is a tad overhyped. It's a good game, but too bloated. Takes way too long. Combat outcomes are too dense and variable to predict with much accuracy. Initially I thought this was interesting but in practice it's very difficult to plan strategies across the war phase, as variables may be very different than expected by the time a critical fight appears, especially since losers of previous fights gain money from the winners. Someone overspending in a fight before (that you aren't even involved in) could mean the opponent in your fight has way more coins than expected, which throws your fight. I like the concept but in practice too convoluted. I also found card powers were either underwhelming (or uninteresting) or super overpowered. Blood Rage gives a similar feel in a shorter, simpler, more streamlined package. Still a good game, and I get why people like it, but too elaborate for me."

+ Rules are quite simple
+ Theme, artwork, and production are stellar.
+ It has a lot of depth and strategic options.
+ No hidden information, so no surprises or luck.
+ Alliances make up for great situations and debates.
+ Best part is the battle mechanisms, it has some psychological back and forth that is amazing, plus super cool ramifications.
+ It has great variability, and the asymmetric factions are awesome.

On the negative side:
- Bonsai clan is broken. It really is. It only works if 
Ryujin (buy cards kami) is available, or the other players are noobs.
- Fox clan is a Kickstarter exclusive. I hate it when they do this, it sucks.
- The alliance system is totally overvalued and overplayed by players.
- But the real complaint is that it's long :-/ too long. It takes us 1h per player.

I really like pretty much everything in the game, but the length kills it, if it played in half the time it would easily by my #1 game. Unfortunate."

While the positioning, mustering and building up are fun in my mind the best part of the game is the War Phase. I love how the order of province fights changes things and I love games where you secretly play something while trying to read what the other player might do.

The negotiation in this game isn't as much as I'd hoped for, but it's present enough to be enjoyable.

Production values are fantastic. Between the beautiful mini scuplts and the kickstarter exclusives Rising Sun is a treat to have on the table. The neoprene mat really elevates this too."

352,candoo,9,"Wow. I'm stunned. I haven't liked any of this designer's other titles.
This might be Lang’s Magnum Opus. 
I only kickstarted it because of the theme.
Pleasantly surprised, in terms of the strategy of game play. 
This is Eric Lang's best work to date. 
Way surpasses Blood Rage, which was just “okay”.  This has much more nuance and depth of play. 
This has a shade of the Diplomacy heritage that it purports to have. There are going to be some sore feelings and some backstabbing. There is also a similarity  to Blood Rage, in that you can gain VPs both by winning and losing battles. Often you gain more VPs by having your guys die. As such, it is not really area control...it’s about how to bid for VPs with money. And monsters are just unnecessary eye candy, as they aren’t actually too powerful. The game play could have been easily serviced with generic wooden cubes and cardboard counters. 

This is not Ameritrash (just the plastic minis are that element). This is a full-on strategy game. Battle resolution is completely deterministic; no dice or card play, but  through board presence and simultaneous money bidding. 

The swinginess of the honour track was a concern at first, but after three plays, it is just a facet of the game, and not a problem. 

The typical problem of Japan based maps in games (guys turtling at the ends, the guys in the middle get hammered) is not an issue here. The mechanics make all provinces fluid: no advantage to the guys at the ends of the maps, and the guys in the middle of the map are not necessarily hammered. There is actually no incentive to turtle in this game...the opposite...you want to get out there to conquer different provinces in order to score more for end game set points. 

WAY-OVER-THE-TOP produced. The bits are phenomenal. And for $150 USD, the Kickstarter content was of relative good value. 

Rating is boosted by its theme and spectacular components.
But I really dislike the unnecessary gore, decapitated heads, and dangling dismembered body parts. It’s a turn off for those playing with kids or family members who don’t want to see that. Actually, it’s a turn off for everyone. 

A note of curiosity is that the battle system is very reminiscent of 2016’s Cry Havoc, which came before Rising Sun. Not sure if Eric Lang knew of Grant Rodiek’s battle system from Cry Havoc. 

Update June 2019. Had to bump my rating from an initial 8 in February 2018 to a 9. The game holds up and got better with more experience.

12 games in, here are my personal rankings of the relative strengths of the clans:

1. Sun - very strong - the only clan that self generates VPs
2. Lotus - very strong
3. Dragonfly - strong
4. Turtle - good
5. Bonsai - situational (weak clan if Lotus buries ""Train"")
6. Moon - situational 
7. Fox - weak and boring to play
8. Koi - hopelessly weak

353,CanisPalus,10,"Blood rage was probably my favorite game, that is until I played Rising Sun.  This game is amazing.  The combat system is the best I've ever played.  Use coins behind a screen to determine which actions to take.  If you lose, you get coins from the winner, setting yourself up for future combat in the round.  You know the order that each province will be fought, so you have to use your limited actions in the season to set yourself up for the round.  You have to be adaptive though, because the territories will be hotly contested, and sometimes killing your own troops will be the best course of action.   The miniatures are fantastic of course.  "

Solo por verlo en la mesa merece la pena jugarlo, luego, cuando te metes en harina se convierte en un divertido juego de mayorías. No todo el mundo comparte esta opinión, pero a mí me gusta más que Blood Rage (con quien se le suele comparar por el autor y el concepto de eurogame sobreproducido). Y después de escribir esto creo que tengo ganas de otra partida, a ver si consigo animar a la gente en el club."

372,Catbug,6,"I see potential for an interesting game but so far the game has mostly been an AP inducing nightmare. Sessions has been long (~4 hours) or just incomplete. 

The fact that Season cards are different every game adds another layer of analysis that halters the tempo; even more exceptions to consider when laying out your strategy for the entire Season. In this regard I prefer Kemet where the potential interactions between special abilities are constant every game and it's easier to learn from experience."
373,cbrook29,8.5,"Great game.  Lot's of diplomacy in this one.  If you do not like making deals and playing one opponent against another and betraying your ally then you might not like this one. 
If definitely has more negotiations than blood rage.  I enjoyed it immensely. Based on more plays I upped my score from 8 to 8.5 on 10/18/18."

375,cdm8387,N/A,pending more plays...
376,cedeo,8.5,"Very seductive game, although my opinion on it shifts alomst play-by-play. At the beginning, seems to offer a perspective on itself that isn't entirely accurate (in regards to combat, negotiation), but as you play, you get used to the strange ways the game really works in. Although much of the strategy is outsourced to a basically uninteractive card market, and although the negotiation aspect sometimes seems to fall apart, AND despite how much of a role random chance in tile draws, kami draws and card availability plays, I can't help but like the game. 
Strong points are the war bidding phase, fight sequence, negotiating in your favour (when it works), table talk and strange interactions that surface in different god/faction combinations.

EDIT after about 6 or 7 plays : We keep playing this, and my opinion seems to be solidifying. There is too much setup variability affecting the balance of the game. However, good play is still rewarded. Just on the brink of being a great game. Tough luck during setup and a few less-than-ideal interactions can you leave you of the game after 1 1/2 of the 3 hours it might take. Despite that, it's often an electrifying mix of tactics and strategy, and I much prefer this kind of (sometimes frustrating) variety to games that smother player interaction in heaps of mechanics and safety nets. I can't help but love it."
377,Celebrith,8.5,"Love this game. Very aesthetically pleasing, especially if you have the KS version. The numerous clans give it diversity - the game doesn't get old as you explore each clan's playstyle and try different win strategies. The only downside is the lengthy set-up, but that's understandable when there's so many miniatures."

Phenomenal Game! Beautiful production, amazing detail on the miniatures, rule book is easy to understand with fantastic visuals and amazing artwork, high quality components especially with the component upgrades from backing the Kickstarter.  Have played the game multiple times, really like the honor track, as well as how the combat phase is played through.  Enjoy the alliance and negotiation aspect of the game.  Only downside I can see is when an “age” (round) is over all players don’t carry over currency to the next age.  In my opinion best if played with even numbers so all players have a chance to be in alliances every round.  Hopefully The Broken Token will produce an insert for all the bonus Kickstarter upgrades.

It definitely has a similar feel to Blood Rage - compete over territories for points over 3 eras, develop your faction with asymmetric special powers - but it feels much more mechanical and abstract then that previous game. The alliance and action-drafting system are much rougher than the similar systems in Blood Rage. My feeling was that at the end of the day, this scratches *exactly* the same gaming itch as Blood Rage, and just isn’t as good.

I like nice minis as much as the next guy, but I feel like they really went berserk with this one to the detriment of the overall effect. There is just so much highly-detailed statuary on the board at any time that it feels overdone and schlocky. YMMV on the aesthetics obviously. OMG though, can we get better designs for the female characters? Blood Rage was pretty bad too. It’s not the worst in that respect that I’ve played, recently (as much as I like Sword and Sorcery, the fantasy bimbos in that game are awful), but come on people. It’s 2018."

Ultimately, I'm just not fond of negociation and area control games with conflict so it just wasn't a game for me.

The art is decent although it doesn't really resonate with me. The minis are beautiful, especially the monsters, and ultimately anticlimactic. The pieces aren't moved around enough to warrant such elaborate detail, and it's no fun that the powerful river dragon can be taken hostage with the exact same effort as for the weakest mini.

On the plus side, I played this a couple times with a group of first-time players. We had a lot of laughs, and I'm glad I gave it a try. I don't think it's ""very bad"" but, in the universe of games I like and games I want to try, I don't think I'll play this again."

I can certainly see why some will really like this. I do like it but I am not a huge fan of dudes on a map to begin with. The Puerto Rico action selection mechanic works well in this, it's probably my favorite part. I like that the combat is quick without too many fiddly phases. The game length runs longer than I would like for a game like this. Of course, with more plays it could shorten, but could also lengthen by all the negotiation.

Rated 9 after one play.

I need to take my initial rating with a grain of salt. First, there's the anticipation of the kickstarter arriving, which predisposes me to wanting to like this game :) But also the style of Rising Sun is right in my wheelhouse. Negotiation, dudes on a map, Euro influence... that hybrid style of design will always get my attention.

So what does Rising Sun do that separates it from other dudes on a map options? For me, there's three standout aspects: 1) the Puerto Rico style of action selection, 2) the combat system and 3) the tech tableau of cards. All of those things blend together very well.

Our first game took 3.5 hours with explanation. That's too long, and I suspect other groups would play faster. I'm not sure if a negotiation style game like this will stick with my typical game group, but it deserves the effort. This probably fires Kemet, which in comparison now feels too sterile and nondescript.

Update: three plays now, and I want to keep playing this. A three player game was better than expected. The smaller number of provinces at war is a bit of a bummer but it scaled better than I expected."
432,ciggie,6,"4 players and a little over 2 hours and I was happy with my decision to sell this. It feels similar to Blood Rage except the drafting is replaced with negotiation probably my least favorite mechanic in a game. We simply made allies just because and with very little thought since we really had no sense of strategy. At least in a first game of Blood Rage you can see what cards people have drafted and hate draft against them pretty easily. Would I play this again yes, but does it offer something that much different from Blood Rage? Not really and with the longer playing time and extra complexity here it's a step below both Blood Rage and El Grande."
433,cinnzel,7,"Un superproducción sobrecogedora en todos los sentidos. Facciones asimétricas, control de territorios, subastas con faroleo e inquietantes demonios del Japón medieval combinados en un juego que se hace algo largo a cinco jugadores, aún siendo ese, su mejor número."

438,Cjhutchi,9,"Played a couple of times so far - excellent game! Balance is perfect, the models are amazing and the alliance mechanic really adds an extra element, especially in 5 player games where not everyone can form an alliance.
The different clans have unique rules, none of which unbalance the game. This is game design at its peak."
439,ClassicFrog,6,"Update:
i am lowering my score of this game from a 9 to a 6.  its hard to make this hit the table the game takes about an hour per player and its just too long.  i am not sure i like how players get an uneven number of market phase actions.  the sun and moon clans are under powered while the fox and lotus clans are overpowered, its not well balanced and hasn't gotten any errata from CMON to fix this.

--------------------------------

Super simple rules for a game with this much depth.  The more players the better.  Still haven't wrapped my brain around the right way to negotiate.  Set up and tear down is a beast.  Take pictures of the plastic mini holders before you remove the minis as a guide for where they go back or you will have a not so fun mini puzzle game as you try every piece in every spot.   Desperately needs a better storage solution.  Consolidatign as best as i can with my KS version the game still takes up almost my entire game bag. (the game canopy) 

This game is a table hog.  needs a full dining room size table to play on.  To give you an idea; the board is 6x the size of the box.  You also need room for all the minis and player boards around that.  

Like Terra Mystica each faction has distinctive strengths and weaknesses and why i bring up TM is that it is not going to be obvious to a first timer what that clan needs to do to win.  The special ability of each clan seems like its easy to tell what you need to do but that can be deceiving.  

Lots of variability between each game.  there are core cards that will always be available each season but add on to that a random selection of ad-on monsters all with thier own unique abilities and I think about 6 sets of different season cards that can be mixed and matched for different experiences each game.  Also the Kami can change between games and the order of battle each season will be variable."

463,Corsairs,8.5,"This game isn't just a pretty face. The tactical choices are tough - tough enough that they can lead to serious analysis paralysis at times. That's the downside. The upside is that the game is surprisingly easy to teach and even more surprisingly quick to play. Furthermore, your strategies will change wildly each game depending on your clan (which each have different powers that feel highly significant) and the random cards and province tiles you draw.

Two slight dings here, both mostly relevant to 3-player games. First, with an odd number of players, somebody is always going to be left out of an alliance. Not that that's a deal-breaker, but it does open the door to ganging up on one player. Second, especially with 3 players, it's possible that the province tile draw on the last turn will mostly turn up tiles that you already have, thwarting set collection and, quite possibly, any hopes of catching up.

Still, this is an eye-catcher of a game that plays smart and relatively quick even at higher player counts. A winner.

After having played it, I was shocked to hear others say there is little to no negotiation or diplomacy in the game.

The rules in the rulebook are not the game, the interactions between the players make up the real game. The game is not without flaws though.

476,crockpot,10,"+ Player alliances is a mechanism. Alliances, betrayals and how you interact players are actual track in the game and effects what you get.

+ Role selection alliances. Role selection but players who you are allied with get bonuses.

+ Getting into alliances with synergy. Some powers you and your alliance member can synergize with.  (I get this card, you get that card and it makes our alliance more since)

+ Rotate cards you draft in and out. Makes each game different and gives you way more content for the buck.

+ Restriction role selection.  You can only select so many roles.  Keeps the game more in controlled.

+ Battles is a round, doesn't happen because you move in the same space with them.  Lets you plan out the battles better.

+ Game rewards you from not turtling. Earn points by getting sets of lands vs sitting on the highest valued land.

+ Losing is a way to win. This lets you play smart other than just get crushed over and over.  Gain points by losing battles.

+ Bid system combat. You can deny players from actions in the game by bidding more than them or you can do more actions by bidding on everything one."

Combat system is really interesting, although I don't like handing my money to my opponent, just feels off. Alliances are fun but the lack of individual actions is a limiting factor. Monsters are often not as impactful as I would have liked. When I kickstarted this I was looking for a combat strategy / units on a map game with alliances and negotiation, but that was before Twilight Imperium IV filled that gap.

491,cswheel0135,6,Fun game but lacking something. There is so much potential to add thematic effect or more meaning to the game but it just ends up being area control heavy slog. The alliance system completely ruins the game in odd number of player settings. Every war phase feels like you know the obvious choice everyone will make and the decision is just to block your opponents suicide or lose honor and win the area. Unfortunetly the awesome miniatures add little besides look to the game. I find it hard to want to play this game without a group of 6

515,danephoto,8,"December 2018

This game always takes 3+ hours, (including a long set up and take down). We have a lot of negotiation in our games, which is fun. But by the time I'm done I say things like ""this is a good game to play once every 3 months."" While I enjoy playing it, I don't ache to play another game immediately after it's over. For that reason I'm bumping my rating down half a point.
______________________

May 2018

I love the combination of variable phase order, area influence, and secret bidding on war advantages. The game can feel a little slow with 5-6 players. I can't tell how much this will change once we've played a few more times. I feel like I'll need 8 games before I feel confident in the strategy for the various factions. But I like the theme and feel of the game."
516,danfix99,8,"Amazing presentation and components.  The main drawback is the game length and pacing.  The game is slow, especially if you are not in that many battles.  Also, I think the negotiation part of this game was a bit oversold, unless you are with the right crowd.  It is definitely better with higher player counts."

529,darker,5,"There's a great deal I really enjoyed about Rising Sun (and I won, which is always a little boost to fun), but the battle system didn't sit well with me. Not from a design standpoint - it's elegant, clever, flexible (allows for a diversity of strategies and aims going into a fight), and ties in very nicely to the rest of the game... but despite all those positives my experience with it was un-fun; the emotional payoff from successful gambits and dramatic moments was drowned out by stress and moments of feeling kinda foolish. Needless to say, this is a very personal reaction, so YMMV. I could see it troubling me less if I played the game frequently, or if we'd played with hidden currency [i](insert HTI argument here)[/i], but it's central enough to the game that I'm not likely to actively seek it out again, despite its virtues and gorgeous production values.

I really liked the incentive for winning in different regions; it both made for a fluid, evolving map and - as the game went on - enabled plausible speculation about what an opponent might be going for, both of which were lovely.

Despite SVWAG's take on the negotiation, we did end up a modest amount of bribery/deal-making going on."

Liked the mandate phase, really liked the variety of cards. The war phase was pretty cool with the blind bidding system for resolving battles. I knew it would be different from Blood Rage, but I didn't expect it to feel this different. I have played with most of the base factions and I can't wait to play with the expansion factions.

The actions are very fun with everyone getting to to follow with an action but the alliance member also getting a stronger action. This game can be very punishing and beat you down. Being able to capture the monsters doesn't make sense to me and makes them less valuable for battle and more than of just a threat. Also, being able to capture someone who is in an alliance with you should break the alliance. It doesn't fit in the theme in my view. It's also a long game and fells difficult to score points and there's many ways to lose them."

560,Deathcloud9,4,"The mechanics didn't seem to click with me, perhaps with more games.  Overly long at 5+ players"
561,Deathhammer66,8,"So here we have it. The spiritual successor of Blood Rage, probably the most hyped game of 2018, another huge kickstarter success with beautiful and big minis, top notch artwork and of course these enormous monsters. Given such a description, some will be exhilarated and buy another astonishing product as they fall before its charm, while others will roll their eyes in a feeling of deep scepticism towards the game, viewing it as a yet another overhyped thing which is trying to hide its average gameplay mechanics beyond the wall of stunning execution and aesthetics. But what really lies behind all of it? 

While the phenomenon I've described above is quite common and not surprising at all, and I understand the perception of both sides, Rising Sun manages to fall into a completely different category. Actually, this game combines an excellent artistic performance AND deep, strategic, rewarding gameplay. Each subsequent Eric Lang's dudes on a map game - with the exception of the Godfather which I have yet to play and which, I believe, is a little bit different kind of beast - becomes more and more devoid of unnecessary elements and fiddly rules in order to create a clean, pure immersion of what a true strategy area control game has to be, what war and struggle for hegemony looks like. Starting with Chaos in the Old World, through Blood Rage(which I view as a theoretical improvement over CitOW but it gives me much less joy and excitement in spite of being a better game objectively speaking) and finally Rising Sun, Eric Lang has achieved something which I dare to say could be called perfection. 

At first glance this game seems like a fairly typical area control where players try to dominate various provinces to reach their goals and get as much benefits as possible. The game structure resembles us all of Blood Rage - three eras, this time in a form of three seasons plus winter which only purpose is scoring, basically. Honestly, similarities end up just here, I have to say. Rising Sun was called a successor of Blood Rage and advertised like that. I think it could lead to massive misunderstanding and deception as only the aforementioned round structure and minis have something to do with BR. The actual gameplay has a completely different feel and dynamics. First of all, how the action selection works has nothing to do with an average way of picking actions in other dudes on a map games. Imagine Puerto Rico with its role selection mechanism. Yup, it has been converted into RS - someone chooses a political mandate and everyone at the table(most of the cases, hehe) gets to do it, while a person who chose it AND his ally gets a bonus. Yes, alliances is another new thing here. While short term alliances have already occured in CitOW in order to stop the current leader, in Rising Sun an element of negotiation is particularly stronger as not only you get to talk and give away money or ronin, but also you're allowed to form an official pact where both of you benefit of having it. Nevertheless, remember that there's only one winner... the ability to form proper alliances at a proper time is a key to victory - and sometimes refusing to have an ally is an excellent move as well! Diplomacy here is not forced - maybe with an exception for the first game - instead it manages to make players think how to use their alliance in the most efficient way to maximize profits from it, taking into account how many VP their ally has at the moment, what's their current board state, what mandate will benefit him the most and is it going to benefit me equally if not better? All these nuances you have to bear in mind and therefore finding an useful alliance is an art itself. 

A battle system is a different story and while it's definitely influenced by Cry Havoc, it's also greatly improved. In that game you were ""bidding"" for battle objectives with units and it was much more predictible, here we have an actual bidding with money behind players' screens. I am not going to delve into the battle system too much, but man how strategic it is, it's a game within game. Each battle, even the one which is surely lost, can be utilized as various objectives include ritualistic suicide, taking hostages, hiring ronins or writing epic poems about those who've just died. Sometimes the one who's lost gains more than the winner... if only he's outsmarted his opponent. And the whole concept of flowing money - I mean, the winner has to give away ALL money he bid among others participating in this particular battle, therefore empowering them in battles which are about to come. Because of that, the order in which fights happen becomes crucial - another simple, yet very deep rule which makes it all even more strategic. Not to mention the element of set collection - winning battles in different provinces over the course of the game rewards the player with a huge boost of VP during winter. Also, it's something which encourages players to change their priorities, to focus on different provinces each round, to move out, it prevents from turtling(unless you're the Turtle Clan, hehe), it makes the game dynamic. 

And so on, and so on. I appreciate the honor system - probably one of the simplest, the most streamlined and elegant rules ever, the ultimate way of breaking ties which occur surprisingly frequently as the game goes on. But those with low honor shouldn't be afraid - there are some cards which will guide their unhonorable way... different strategies tend to emerge, depending on the board state, the provinces in which there's going to be a war, available Kamis and season cards, hell, even the clans participating in a game as each one has a gamebreaking ability - and that's not an overstatement, yet Eric Lang somehow managed to keep their balance. After 4 plays I'm pretty confident that there's nothing broken and everything can be counterplayed only if players are on equal experience level. 

Deep, rewarding, utterly satisfying, replayable, diplomatic, with so many going on while using a fairly simple set of rules. Second best dudes on a map game with Inis being the first. But maybe...

Edit: Unfortunately, the game seems too simplistic(!) during the political phase. Most of decisions feel just flat. The fun lies mainly in the battle system, which I consider gorgeous. Therefore I've got to drop this to 8. I'm still eager to play it, but there are deeper dudes on a map games - I had to play this ~15 times in order to understand it, so don't worry, this still has enough potency & replayability to consider owning it. I just feel there's too much talking about things which turn out NOT to be that important - all in all, it all depends how you play out your battles."

Not much fun. Rising Sun is worse...it's not too difficult to figure out who is going to win any individual combat, so the loser will more often than not commit seppuku, write a poem, and come out of the combat far better than the winner did. We had one combat where all three people tried to commit seppuku. Stupid, not fun. Plus it seems odd that the best strategy for those actually trying to win combats is to win a fight and move to another place and win a combat and then keep going...no reason to defend an area of the board, no home spaces. Once you have won a combat in an area you have no reason to defend it. The game just doesn't seem like a war game at all.  And if you aren't going to have big exciting battles why have all those cool monsters?

As usual in one of Lang's games there is no long-term strategy, just try to get points however you can this turn. Again, no feeling of warfare. Pretty game, though. I'm not a big fan of Blood Rage, but it's better than this and at least sort of feels like a Viking game. This feels nothing like feudal Japanese warfare should feel."

The game is conflict oriented and you cannot win by outsmarting others during gameplay. You absolutely need to cooperate och negotiate constantly and well to win this game. But you will most likely need to backstab others as well, even your closest friends and allies.

Furthermore, the game has cool miniatures. Or not. It certainly adds to the feeling of wonder as well as the price tag. It's great to buy a Dragon to rule the land, just to lose it in a betrayal the very next moment."

I like the slower pace of RS, where BR is primarily about battles, RS shines more in positioning."

Rising Sun is another beautiful game well-worth backing the Kickstarter for all the extra special bonuses and game enhancements. And it largely succeeds at being an open-ended experience where the playstyles of the people at the table determine the type of game that's played. That being said, I'm not sure it's quite reached it full potential with me yet, for the following reasons:

>>While the game's ruleset isn't complex and is intuitive to follow, the amount of cards/monsters that break the rules and vary the game can be overwhelming. It leads to constantly having to ask ""what does your guy do?,"" which can telegraph your next move and it definitely slows down the game. My hope is that with more plays, this will start to fade, and ultimately solely serve its purpose for varying each play of the game.

>> The game's intended aspects of negotiation and betrayal are falling flat. I noticed how the rule book goes out of its way to suggest ways for wheeling and dealing to occur, but it just isn't happening much in our games, and that isn't for a lack of trying. There's no guarantee of what tile choices will come when your ally plays, so any deal feels weak. And for that same reason there's not a lot of suspense with betrayal. For example, if I knew for sure that my ally could get me the Harvest tile bonus and yet, he then betrayed me -- that would be sweet drama. But if his draw of action tiles are worthless to me, then the alliance and possible betrayal is ... meh. Games like Tammany Hall and Cosmic Encounter do a better job here with creating tensions among alliances and deals.

>> Speaking of those action tiles, I think the sweetspot for this game might be three players ... maybe four ... because otherwise, you don't have much of a choice in getting to play the tiles you want. With five or six players the game tends to bog down a little.

>> Finally, while there would seem to be plenty of paths of victory in this game, it seems to largely come down to the cards and how you combo them.  So if the Kami card shrine is out and someone dominates it, that player will usually win. If you ignore cards, you might be able to grab an early lead, but in the end a good card player will be able to surpass all your abilities and dominate that final round. In other words, you have to spend a good chunk of the game building your card engine or at least part of it hate drafting.

Still, with these issues, I do really enjoy the game, especially the bidding aspect of battles, where you can find cunning ways to win ... or lose and win.

At this point, similar games like Blood Rage and Kemet still rank higher for me, but Rising Sun might have legs to move higher."

I love the theme,the game is gorgeous... but I spend the entire game trying to figure out which of the 11 ways to get screwed over I'm going to have to deal with, and I'm not even including ""Betrayal."" After this most recent game, 4 of the 6 were just complexly ticked off from the chain of events that unfolded, and this is a group that don't get hurt feelings over games and enjoys playing traitor-y and take-that types of games (Game of Thrones, Blood Rage, The Resistance, ie games that involve conflict or deception/betrayal).

I think the greatest praise I can give this game is that even though alliance and negotiation are hardcoded into the design, you can actually play the game without these features and have it stand on two feet, the design is that good. Repeat plays will show how well it  fares though I am thinking that it's as good as blood rage, though perhaps slightly less accessible; though no one part of the design is complicated, it's just got two very different sections: the war phase and the mandates; I like the combat, which is solid and quite akin to Cry Havoc (ahem, very akin!), but I think the mandates more interesting and take obvious lineage from Puerto Rico, no complaints there. Clan special powers are fun and the components are top notch. In fact, the best kickstarter exclusives aren't 'minis' per se, but the strongholds, the flags and the unnecessarily gorgeous melamine (?) mandate tiles. I can understand the decision to not ship at retail with 6 clans, to keep cost and box size down, the shelves are groaning under the colossal bulk anyway. And you can get another clan through the dynasty expansion.  However, you could play this game with cubes without losing much, in fact I for one would prefer it and would have liked to have seen a slimmed down version that was entirely focused on the game and marketed at a lower price, you could have kept the monsters as minis or not, stickered discs would have worked. Speaking of the monsters, though the sculpts are amazing: they so big that the game looks insane on the table. They could be half sized and still dwarf the other minis. They make the board look busy when readability is essential. That's a small nitpick really, the overall package is excellent.

My only two problems with the game are the alliance mechanic, which is already discussed here. The other thing is the lack of “style”. Besides of killing you own soldiers in ritual suicide, there is nothing related to the Japanese theme besides the minis and the art. This game is so polished, you could release it as an abstract strategy game for thirty bugs and I would find it awesome. There are no “unnecessary” stylish game mechanics attached to its core mechanics. Right now it is for me a beautiful “painted” and overproduced abstract strategy game with a discussable alliance aspect."

Our group played a few games of Blood Rage, and a few games of this since their release.  Of the two, I prefer this one.

It’s not perfect: it kind of has the same problem Blood Rage has, just much less severe.  Specifically, what you’re trying to do in the game is take over territories.  There are 6 regions in the game, and 3 rounds.  At the end of each round, there’s a big battle in each place, and if you win, you get a chip for that province.  Collect as many different territories’ chips as you can for a big set collection scoring at the end of the game.  Getting a full set is a lot of points (also difficult), and this successfully manages to drive the conflict in the game.  If you do get a full set, that’s a big boost towards winning, but there are so many other points sources that it can be overwhelmed by the end.  I’d be a little happier if the set scoring was a little higher, and more granular.  As it stands, you don’t get any more points for 5 than you do for 4, or 3 than 3. (need to recheck this - memory fuzzy)

The rest of the game’s systems work more or less as they should.  Alliance formation allows you to negotiate for control of regions.  Each of the actions but 2 is useful and self-explanatory.  I think the worship action is potentially a little under-powered, since it depends heavily on which deities got dealt out at the beginning.  If you manage to invest in a good one at the start, it’s worth it, but fighting a zero-sum battle with your opponents over diminishing rewards really isn’t.  The Betray action is the one that seems weak, and very situational.  I often see it being skipped and left til late as it means breaking your alliance for pretty meager gains.  

The differing sets of deities and cards in each game keeps it fresh, plus there are many factions to try out.

I found the negotiation either too aggressive or too awkward (with shy players), and it is specially weird if you have an odd number of players. I love the alliance mechanism, I just dont like the open negotiation format to get to it.
I almost wish there was a mechanical rules defined way to make and rotate the alliances... and that is because everything else is great, the mechanisms, the theme, the art, everything...  In my opinion the game remains great even without the negotiation.
I even would love to see a non-alliance 2 player variant."

Played with Kami unbound expansion and Rising Sun Daimyo box. 

Extremely overproduced game, I'm baffled that people are willing to pay so much money for this game. Yes, the miniatures are greatly produced, amazingly detailed and really cool to see but I can't seem to be the person who would fork out so much money (700+ MYR) for this game.

So I won my first game but I honestly DID NOT put much effort at all. (It was actually a two way tie but I won the tie-breaker by being higher on the honour track). I was a little bit drawback because the owner mentioned that there is negotiation and creating alliances in this game. Any games with negotiation reminds me so much of the horror of Genoa, and any games with allies reminds me how terrible I was in Diplomacy.

I find that to be able to negotiate or forming allies, you need to really understand the game well. I was clueless as what to negotiate and who to ally with until I'm 2/3 deep in the game. After I've gotten the hang of it, I then understand who to ally with and why do you want to form ally with one other player. By that time it was too late but hey still won. 

Ok so yeah I won, but honestly I was really clueless the whole game. Yes, the game explainer explained the game very well. It's just how I'm a little slow in picking up games with so many rules mashed together. Plus, any games where you need to refer to a lot of things just annoy me. This game has so many characters with special rules I honestly never bother to really try to understand them all. So this is very personal mind you.

Honestly, these are clearly just my personal nitpicks. Reason why I LOVE Nexus Ops. It's so elegant with no convoluted rules (seriously get that game if you're reading this).

The reason why I won the game while still being clueless is because of the season cards. I had zero monsters, plenty of season cards and only won one battle (in the last epoch; I think that's what it is called, that one battle gave me 3 points from winning the province tile) in the entire game, and I only ever received one reward (through harvest) from an area that is not contested (I was the only player there because that area does not offer points for the current epoch).

So my points came entirely, hugely from my season cards. I've had season cards that gave me plenty of points, and also season cards that gave me extra point for taking hostage, and also points from having built stronghold. These cards are so cheap to be obtained I have no idea how Eric M. Lang priced them. There are cards that give you many points but the cost of the card is ZERO. I mean, like heck? Some cards are pricey and give you no points? Ok I really don't get it.

I had ZERO monsters throughout the game, never get to control the Kami (actually once; the one that allows me to buy season card) and I was wholly focus on getting myself killed because that is what gave me  a lot points (from the bidding actions; seppuku and Imperial Poets). On top of that, my season cards all contribute more points if I ever do just that. 

So based on this formula, I tried to bring in as many figures as I can into play. Not just that, they're all better to be on as many different areas as I can. Having a lot of figures 
on plenty of different areas cost me a lot of money to win the bid during war. So, now it has become a game of out guessing my opponents on which action space I could win or tie on the bidding action space. Plus, most of the time I won the tie as I'm always at the high placing on the honour track; which I never controlled. These players kept doing something that kept bringing my honour token high up.

So all in all, it felt so weird and not thematic at all when all I did was just killing myself and not battling at all. My goal is to try and kill myself as many times as possible. Repeat until the game ends.  It worked and I won the game without MANY effort.

This left me this very weird taste about this game. I think it's an okay game to be honest. I believe my only one experience and my victory were pure situational kind of thing with the drawn seasonal cards that favour me a lot.

Still can't make up my mind about it but right now, it's just an okay game. I wouldn't want to play it again but that's only because of the constant referring to abilities and whatnot.

Gameplay took us 3 hours without teaching."

Amazing strategy game which flows smoothly and feels fast but it isn't. It swallows 3 hours in one bite. There are 3 intricate and exceptional mechanisms, all refined from classic games of old. Mostly. Action mechanic reminds me of Puerto Rico. Battle mechanic reminds me of Cry Havoc. There is negotiation a la Diplomacy. And overall it reminds of Shogun.

Not everybody will love this game, for sure and it won't work in every setup but it offers great fun especially with those fantastic miniatures.

It's also a little heavier with obvious inspiration from Puerto Rico (the political phase).  The battles felt more devastating and emotional in this game - which is in part of the ingenious simultaneous action selection and bidding in the war phase.  It's worth noting that Rising Sun does have a steep learning curve for new players and is tougher to just jump into and figure out compared to Blood Rage (or the very good The Godfather: Corleone's Empire that came out last year).

The bidding combat system was kind of neat, but felt repetitive and inconsequential by the end. The action choosing system was interesting in theory, but was super frustrating in actuality.

Lots of variability in the box, and I'm sure it has a long life ahead of it. Not sure if it'll stick with me as hard as Blood Rage has, but I have enjoyed my first couple of plays thus far.

It does seem to shine more with further plays, as more strategies become apparent. My biggest beef is probably the length, as it doesn't seem possible to get games shorter than three hours. Probably would be shorter with less players, but I'd have to find out.

4 players was sub-2 hours, so that's good.

In the end, it just didn't resonate with me enough to warrant keeping it."
710,emperormark,5,Baffled by this one. It's average at best.
711,emptycupoz,7,"KS: base set + expansion + playmat (~AUD275). Arrived Jan 2018. Played four times - tends to go to around 4 hours with 5 players, and 2.5 hours with 3. I love the minis and the regular negotiation. The mandates seem pretty straightforward with the main decision to be whether to play for individual benefit or overall alliance benefit, though Harvest has a lot of subtlety. I like the hidden choices for battle advantages, though this part of the game has the biggest downtime. It is interesting that the Ronin can swing the results of battles in a big way, which then leads to choices about whether you try to start with more force in a province or commit seppuku early to make their efforts to win Ronin in vain. Note that seppuku is optional for the winner, so you can look ahead at the other coin choices made before you decide whether or not to do it.

I purchased the metal coins and Folded Space inserts off Richard for around $120. It's really nice to be able to fit the components into 2 boxes (besides the mat)

I haven't played this game at all in 2019 and have other wargames in a boardgame such as Root and Cry Havoc that are more compelling at the moment."

Das Material ist in der KS Version der knaller schlecht hin wie wir es von CMON gewohnt sind.

Aber so richtig gefällt mir das Spiel nicht da es einfach too much ist von den Möglichkeiten und Verbale Diplomatien.

All die sachen zu überblicken bei all den massig möglichkeiten macht es recht chaotisch und unübersichtlich und man hat nie das Gefühl die Kontrolle zu haben.
Der andere Punkt ist das die Absprachen und Diplomatischen beziehungen zu viel Einfluss im Spiel einnehmen.
Wenn man Spiele wie Diplomacy oder Junta mag dann ist das hier auch wohl was für den jenigen.
Für mich ist das einfach nichts da es das noch chaotischer und unplanbarer macht da man hier Ronin und Geld einfach einem Spieler geben kann damit er definitiv bestimmte Kämpfe gewinnt.

In unserem letzten Spiel habe ich keine Siegchancen mehr gehabt und habe somit einem anderen Spieler immer zugearbeitet damit er gewinnt und dadurch hat er auch gewonnen.
Hier ist zu viel Einfluss durch einen Spieler möglich der den Spielsieg für sich aufgibt.

Im Endeffekt ist es ein nettes Spiel aber wie gesagt die Planungssicherheit ist absolut nicht gegeben was mir bei anderen Spielen deutlich besser gefällt.

Daher wirds meine Sammlung direkt wieder verlassen,
Schade, Bei dem schönen Material hätte ich mir ein schöneres Spiel drumrum gewünscht."

768,familywontplay,5,"This is definitely a game where it is important to know the cards for working combinations & which to keep away from the other players--so you need to be very familiar with all the clans and their special abilities.  
     There is so much going on in this game, and since it is not a game I am likely to play often, the extensive rules will have to be taught & reviewed every time.
      Also negotiations and alliances are important, but since I hate Diplomacy, this is not an attractive feature for me either.
      It is a beautiful game with amazing components (I played the pimped out version) and someone who likes to paint miniatures might get the game for this reason alone.  However, putting this game away with all its components is a fiddly nightmare.    It took 6 people about 10 minutes to put this kickstarter game away.
     In our game one of the clans lapped everyone else.  There was talk that this overpowered clan should not be used--of course with 6 players, you have to own the expansion in order to do this.  I feel sure this game must have been highly play-tested, so I tend to think players haven't figured out how to play the other clans.  It does appear though, that if a clan gets a very advantageous card early in the game,  they might not be stoppable.

779,felherc,9,"A highly strategic, brain-burning game. All the interacting mechanisms make every decision crucial but, with the very thick fog of war from the uncertainty in other players' actions, it is hard to know how things will develop after you have made your choice. The amount of information that you could consider to make that (maybe) ""right"" decision does impose a certain learning curve that rewards experience. The tension is kept high throughout, and peaks during battles—where often you must end up committing to a risky move. It is exhilarating when you realize you correctly ""read the mind"" of your opponent and managed to tip the scale in your favor. The negotiation aspect does not seem to play a central role. The clan asymmetry is cool and contributes to the replay value together with the multiple god, deck, and monster choices. I did find that some clans have more predefined strategies than others.

The components are of impressive quality, and I was amazed at how CMON even outdid themselves with the miniatures after Blood Rage. While highly evocative through its art and terminology, Rising Sun is not a very thematic game and certainly not a war game. Your enjoyment can greatly depend on how much you accept it for its own strategic nature that is often distanced from its theme.

Since Blood Rage and Rising Sun are both great, tension-filled, eye-candy packages, I would recommend to go viking for shorter, more casual sessions; and to go samurai if you are yearning for a longer, more strategic and involved experience."

786,Ficiani,8.5,"Amazing board game if you love negotiations, alliances, bluff and backstabbing. The first game with our group took about 4 hours but we had an absolute blast.
There were secret agreements (which are not binding), bribing and asking for mutual favors. I can easily say that more than 60-80 min of our gameplay was only negotiations, forming alliances and bribing before the war phase.
The gameplay changes every 5 minutes with each person choosing a strategic option and therefore the strategy you made earlier no longer applies so you have to think again. The game is really exhaustive to the brain because it requires a lot of concentration, strategies and tactic, but we loved it!
At the end, only one can be a winner so betraying someone is inevitable and will happen sooner or later.
The game is best with 4 players but we had an amazing time with 5 players as well (one will always be without an alliance). At the end, it depends on your group whether you'll prefer it for 4 or 5 players more.
The only con (especially at this price tag) is that if you want to experience the full experience (with a 6th player being added) you'll need to buy an expansion (Dynasty Invasion) which will set you back 50$ more, which really becomes expensive.
Overall a 9 and a game that must be in your collection if you like negotiation, bluffing and alliances types of games."

Magát a játékmenetet leginkább puerto rico - blood rage gyereknek nevezném. Jópofa a központi akcióválasztós mechanika, ami PR szerűen a választónak extra előnyöket ad, de magát az akciót mindenki végrehajthatja. Itt annyi a csavar még, hogy az előnyöket a a választó szövetségese is megkapja. Maga a klánfejlesztés és a táblán machinálás meg leginkább blood rage-es. Érdekes még a harc, ami talán a legjobb, amit eddig ebben a műfajban láttam. A licitálás és a konkrét akciólehetőségek nagyon feszült helyzetet eredményeznek, amiben lehet kockáztatni is, de általában biztosra is lehet menni, nyilván kisebb előnyt elérve ezzel.
A szövetségközősdi és a megvesztegetés része nekem nem annyira állt össze. Szerencsére vesztegetés nélkül is lehet játszani. A szövetségre szükség van, hogy érdekes legyen a játék, de elég wtf érzés az első körben a semmire megkötni őket, de később se válik teljesen egyértelművé, hogy kinek-kivel érdemes. Ez egyáltalán nem kieurózható rész, itt mindenképp szükség van a társaság aktív részvételére, dumájára, mert maga a játék/játékhelyzet nem sok kiindulást nyújt."
790,fjaoaoaoao,7,"Though it's dudes on a map, there is a lot more focus on strategy, patience, and utilizing cultural elements of Japan rather than direct conflict.  It's an improvement over Blood Rage (BR) which is a lot more brash and straightforward -> while there are opportunities to win with tricky behavior in BR, people who love competition and aggressive play are really drawn to it, whereas Rising Sun adds additional layers.

The layers Lang has added are centered around more social and psychological aspects of gaming via alliances, negotiation, bidding/auctioning, action order, reparations, etc.  Reparations is a cool feature since this is something that often gets ignored in war, that is, there are repercussions to conflict beyond the losing party being exterminated or feeling negative emotions.

An area in which it feels weaker than BR is that the monsters and actions do not feel as magical or mythological.

Alliances might not always be fair in 3 players, but alliances can re-form as needed. On the other hand, the alliances are not terribly punishing, and it can be beneficial to not have an ally (ie via harvesting).

Also the play is quick for its complexity, provided there isn't someone who takes a long time to make decisions or negotiates a lot.  Maybe I would need to play more to get a better gauge of this.

Like BR, there is also a ""So-What?""-ness to the game, that is, a real lack of growth or narrative other than getting more stuff and conquering territory better than your opponents, but the design is elegant enough to keep things intriguing."

793,FlaminYawn,10,"I can only say good things about games that get you thinking about them outside of play and this is one of those games. It relies on victory points to win, but there are several ways to go about getting high on the victory track.

This game utilizes alliances well, helping players that help others. However, if someone is winning too much, you can betray them and refuse allying with them to prevent point bonuses. Hence, I'd say this game is best with 5 just so you can force someone that's winning too fast to go alone for one round. 

There is also a really cool mechanic in the war phase that divvies out the coins used by the winner to each of the losers. This makes the last few battles very close and gives the blind bidding extra tension."

Played 2 times, and both times I had similar things happen in the battle system where I thought I had something and I was completely destroyed.  Granted it was an error on my part, but left such a bad taste in my mouth I won't ever touch this one again.  Terrible gaming experience for me.  Thing was I knew I was going to be in last place at the end of the game and going into the last round for the most part I was okay with that.

Gives Blood Rage and Chaos in the Old World a run for their money, but if you have the chance you may want to pick up those first.

My main criticism of this game is that everything in it is so discrete. Every change of status on the board (that other players enact on their turn) feels like it hurts you in some way, so sometimes playing it can feel like you're dying by a thousand cuts before it's your turn again. It's light on letting you be resilient enough to withstand any kind of development. Instead, you feel the pain immediately. Except for the battle auctions, but those are so ambiguous and your resources are so constrained they turn on a hairpin. 

In Blood Rage, you build up to exciting moments before you either triumph or have the floor fall out from under you. That's exciting. In Chaos, you can foresee developments and try to shape events with your resources before you get to the exciting battle phase. In Rising Sun, you're constantly getting smacked in the face. But when it's your turn it makes you feel like you have your chance. You better not blow it! That's cool too. "

- Streamlined rules for a brain-burning game.

- The game encourages you to think one or two steps ahead. 
- AMAZING MINIS!
- An amazing amount of replayability (if you have the KS version)

NEGATIVES
- Extremely cut-throat. If you don't like take-that or competitive games in general, don't play this game. 
- Players have to be willing to adapt and change strategies from round to round. 
- The miniatures don't always reflect the game play compared to Blood Rage.

He brings his good sense of integrating variety of tried-and-true mechanics into something that feels new, and blends that with interesting asymmetry and creates lots of room for making weighty decisions and trying novel strategies. Rising Sun might not feel wholly innovative like Chaos in the Old World, but it runs on the same train as Blood Rage in terms of design approach, which I think has been working quite well for Mr. Lang. Yes, there are hints of Chaos and Blood Rage, but also Puerto Rico, Scythe, and the 1980s MB classic, Shogun. Lots of ""spiritual successor"" games can feel like re-hashes but Rising Sun is its own beast. Even if the game isn't breaking new ground, the one-two punch of production team Cool Mini and illustrator Adrian Smith just makes for such an enjoyable experience, where aesthetic is clearly as important as the game mechanics themselves. Fortunately, both receive high marks. The game might have felt a little long for a first-time play, but surely experience groups could get this going at a better pace and 2 hours is possible. So overall, a beautiful-looking game that is a joy to play and another notch in the collective belts of CMon, Eric Lang, and Adrian Smith."

#AreaControl

Similar to Blood Rage, but more complex. Too many big monsters for my taste. A little bit less movement possibilities. War phase should use a timer. There were people that thought about 2-3min where to place the coins! I think 1min should be enough.

855,Gary Praxis,7,Decent area control game even if the negotiation elements are oversold. Unlike it's predecessor the amazing creature miniatures are slightly underwhelming from a gameplay perspective. Would play but don't need to own.
856,GaryP,2.5,"Played one six-player game.  Never felt like I was *doing* anything or making any actual progress, yet I finished in third place.  At a time in life when I have precious little time to game with others, that was three hours that feels wasted.  The bidding during combat was interesting, but it needs a MUCH faster game to go with it.  I will almost certainly decline if asked to play this again.

Feels a bit weird, but it seemed fast for us, and without a lot of choices. Too easy, not deep enough.
Meh."
862,gdsefwffqfwe,1,"1) if you have fallen behind half way through the game, there is no real way to come back, so you just wait and it drags until the end

2) the heavy diplomacy breaks the game. you can spend 10 minutes strategizing, only to have one player give another player a coin/ronin and turn the balance. there are just too many variables, and unless you want to think by youself for 10 minutes each time its your turn, you have to guess.

3) that same randomness turns this game in a bit of a slugfest 

4) honor is way to heavily favored, especially since there is no straightforward way to move up the honor track. 

5) games easily hit 3 hours (with experienced players)

6) kickstarter version has too much extra content compared to retail (not cool)

7) each card/monster/virtue/faction has specific rules which you need to carefully read up on. which causes the game to just drag while players make decisions

I suppose 1 star is fair, as its pretty to stare at."

882,giltleaf,5,"This is a good game that meshes negotiation with a dudes on the map nicely. A lot of this game is misrepresenting the strength of different players at different times to use alliances to your advantage- which is something I really like but is definitely draining. Other games make this a little more interesting - cosmic encounter for more freewheeling, lords of Vegas for pure excitement, or dogs of war for more levels. The best part of the game is bidding on what combat actions you want - one coin can make the difference in a large number of points and consistent smart spending can really add up over time even if you don't win a lot of combats in a particular round (talking about point maxing from hostage, sepuko, and poets options). This also makes it so you're never really out of the game if  you have a bad round of fighting. Unfortunately the exciting combat bidding seems to take up way less of the game than a not so great alliance phase and a lackluster draft/action selection phase. The minis and the market cards in general are pretty samey and boring - while this does a good job of balancing the game, it sucks out variety. Overall, I'd rather play dogs of war for a prompted/tricky area control negotiation game, or blood rage/kemet for a dudes on a map game with cool powers. This is still good, just not going to displace anything for me. Was close to buying but I'll pass. "

886,Glasgow17,6.5,"Good area control game with perhaps too much variety when it comes to monsters (I've played with the kickstarter edition). Great fighting mechanic, but the overabundance of monsters and abilities makes it difficult to resolve battles without having to consult the rule book several times. You probably get used to it after multiple plays, but the level of complexity means that experienced players who are familiar with the cards will almost always win. The basic mechanics are quite straightforward, but choosing the right combination of monsters and cards requires several sessions. The game seems perfect for 5-6 players as battles towards the end are hilariously chaotic, but the problem is that it is very long. With 3 and 5 players, someone will not be able to make any alliances, and this is a considerable disadvantage. I don't think the negotiation phase really works, this is the kind of game where you are always going to be stabbed in the back. Overall, too long and confrontational for my taste. I prefer games where your main goal does not consist of destroying the other players."
887,Glassquid,3,"Really didn't enjoy the game. The Alliance system is really weird and there is no balancing and a lot of dead ends. almost unplayable with an odd number of players.

918,greggre12288,8,"Fascinating variable player powers and a beautiful production. Lots of great interaction and table talk. Treat it like Cosmic Encounter or Intrigue in some ways, and try to think about how to leverage other players' positions to get what you want.

The big downside is that there's surprisingly lots of ways to just get totally screwed over, through no fault of your own.  I'm not just talking about people allying against you. I'm talking about kingmaking issues in which someone might throw a lot of money into a fight as a way to launder money to someone who will fight you in a later battle. Stuff like that is super hard to predict and plan against, and just feels very frustrating.

921,gregory156,4,I have problem with the conflict resolution based on bidding. Played twice and haven't enjoyed it. 
922,Grey Pilgrim,6,"Rising Sun is an interesting conglomeration of bluffing, set collection, and action selection in the guise of a territory control game. Players will battle for control of gods and certain territories each turn while negotiating alliances for more powerful actions to try to win a battle in each territory at least once. For a ""30 second elevator pitch,"" few games can compare to Rising Sun. Each specific mechanic is very well done. Choosing actions make alliances and negotiating yield positive results, controlling territories is only necessary in key locations, and bluffing a bid to earn the right to battle actions is a great experience. In action, though, Rising Sun loses some flow with all these mechanics. While very well done, each instance seems too short to feel meaningful. Rising Sun is more of an appetizer of board game's greatest hits. The experience is unique, and the game has a powerful feel that is worth experiencing. Once the veneer is removed, though, what's left is something that plods along, a slave to its mechanics and phases. Fortunately, the veneer is a wonderful one, and I can happily say that every time I've played Rising Sun, there has been something to enjoy."

I need to play more, but based on my experiece with the game so far, my opinion won't be changing much.
Have to play more before deciding, but so far I think the game should be played with 5 people, so the alliances never contemplate everyone."

And that's fine. There's enough here to carry the game in spite of that. It made me want to play Blood Rage, though, more than anything.
But man, the production values are top notch. Amazing minis, even if they are skull-heavy and not terribly clan-cohesive.
[EDIT] The appeal is waning ion this one. The system is pretty obtuse, and small ripple effects can completely hose you."
938,H00T,9,"I love everything about this game: the mechanics, the artwork, the miniatures... EVERYTHING! I am a big fan of the theme, so Rising Sun edges out Blood Rage for me (sorry, inevitable comparison). The overall production quality is top-notch and the board is gorgeous.

I can go either way on area control games, but there's so much more to this game that makes it great. Issuing mandates is interesting in that only the mandating player (and possible ally) will benefit from the bottom row action. Forming alliances is also a great part of this game. There's also a small amount of deck-building implemented in the training phase, however, my favorite has to be the bidding and bluffing war phase.

Overall, the game is not as complex as it looks. The rule book is thorough and there are plenty of online tutorials to assist. The phases of each season are streamlined and play will have a nice pace once players acclimate to them. My only complaint is that some of the miniatures offer little ability/benefit when compared to their over the top presence on the board. An amazing game and one of my new favorites!"

I love how this game has eliminated some of the big issues with normal ""mini's on a map"" games by forcing you to move and attack different regions in each round of the game. You can't just bunker in, stay in one spot and win the game. It also uses the Purto Rico method of picking actions so everyone gets to do something, even when it's not your turn which is a great thing in games that are longer. Also, I love the combat mechanic in this game. It's so different from other games that I have played, forces you to make wise and hard decisions the whole time.
Whew, as I'm writing this I may be tak=lking myself into ranking this one above the other Lang game here in a second...idk they are both awesome and I adore them both.

What Other People May Not Like/problems that I ignore: the combat in this game divides people. Some (like myself) think its brilliant, while many others use it as the only reason to not like the game. I can basically guarantee you will like the rest of the game regardless but since the combat is such a large part of the game I can totally see people avoiding this game if the combat style isn't for you.

People are going to want to know how it compares to Blood Rage.  Honestly, they are very different games and shouldn't be compared to one another other than the fact they have area control mechanisms.

AND THEN, if someone goes up on the honor track, you go down.  That is bogus.  The designer knew this game was broken, so he probably said hey let's throw negotiation in there. And then, in a 5-6 player game, you may never get first player so you will never get that extra turn unless you ally but who is going to ally with you if you are last player. "

Rising Sun is a typical Eric M. Lang game. It is the uncharitable bastard child of Chaos in the Old World and Blood Rage. Unfortunately Rising Sun combines the worst of both games. What it boils down to is a 3 hour bluffing game - if you got the ressources - mixed into some kind of area control orgy - if you got the units. At a random chance you won't have either. This is when the lack of influence you can have frustrates you while you wait for the others to finish their moves. Then the downtimes are a strain. Quite underwhelming. 

I think I'll pass."

There is no benefit of ""turtling,"" as you always need to spread out.  Hidden action selection in battles is interesting.  Main action selection (from the available cards) is underwhelming and can be annoying if you are forced into a particular choice. Definite opportunities for king making.

1015,imaginaryforce,9.5,"Masterpiece of area control. The political phase and the war phases are so different and uniquely awesome that the game could be split into two. In both phases of the game, there are always many things to consider and many tough decisions to be made. The game is highly asymmetrical but extremely well balanced, always offering players multiple options to outmaneuver opponents. The game has always a strong sense of micro versus macro decisions. Do I invest resources now to win the majority at a certain Kami or do I let that go and focus on the big picture, or a few turns ahead? This always gives the player many factors to consider as well as being a mind game between the people at the table. The war phase is also an amazing mind game of secret betting and determining, on a macro level, which fights to win and which fights to lose.

The cherry on top of this game is the ability for players to negotiate freely, in a Cosmic Encounter or Twilight Imperium-like manner which adds a whole other layer to the game as well as making it more fun and entertaining.

The number of clans available, combined with the modularity of the Kami, the season cards and the monsters allow for fantastic replayability although the game feels like it could be easily played over and over with the same exact settings to allow groups of gamers to develop their own meta-game, to learn and improve their strategies or come up with new ways to counter specific play-styles or clans.

The artwork is stunning and the components quality of the Kickstarter version are a nice plus although the upgrades are mostly cosmetic. The game is well worth also in it's retail form.

1019,Immermnemion,7.5,"In the vein of Game of Thrones and Dune, Rising Sun has a focus on area control. Allies are temporary stepping-stones to your goal, for there is no allied victory here. The political mandate tiles encourage some betrayal during each of the game's 3 rounds of play (round 4 is just scoring). Expect bickering and backstabbing, but the blind bidding nature of the battles combined with some randomness during initial setup's god and card offers makes for a swingy game. Sometimes, this can lead to significant salt at the table if miscalculations lock someone out of even a snowball's chance at winning early on."

1035,iquito,8,"I really like the interaction between players, although one has to have players who want to negotiate, because everything is partly balanced by haggling. The different player powers make this even more of a must, as every clan has great advantages in some fields, but not in others. The war phase is really fun for its mind games, with a lot of unintended consequences. I think it will become better with more plays as negotation picks up even more.

EDIT: After some time thinking about it, I still think Rising Sun is a good game, but the mechanics and interactions seem a bit erratic - it is hard to grasp what each action will lead to, making it an ""obtuse"" game in a negative way. Also, different player counts make it quite different. I do think it is fun and has good elements, but I am not sure if there are not better games I would rather play, especially for the length. If you know the mechanics well and like mind games and area control with point salad, this is still very good, and might become better once everyone gets to know it really well."

I was initially attracted to the game for Eric Lang's reputation and the wonderful art and pieces seen in the Kickstarter. I must say, the pieces are extremely detailed and absolutely gorgeous, and I'm blown away by each and every single one of the miniatures and game pieces.

The game plays quite smoothly in my opinion; it's rather streamlined and easy to understand and shaky truces in the Tea Party Ceremony add a nice caveat to the game.

1073,jaturul,6.5,"It was fine, but I do enjoy this game less each time I play it. 

First of all, the systems in this game feel very game-y. For example, when we played - one player committed sepuku and hired Ronin which doesn't make much sense - who hires and commands those Ronins if the army just kills itself.

But the bigger problem is the victory points. They are a mix of glory (gain from sepuku), economic wellbeing (gain from regions) and military superiority (region conquering). It's like a stew of different ingredients that doesn't taste very good (i.e. it's an abstraction that doesn't make much sense). What's worse is that some cards and creatures interact with those points. And that just is total abstraction that doesn't make me imagine anything interesting.

In terms of that, a comparison with Cyclades is interesting - there you also have monsters that are not the star of the game. BUT. Their effect impacts the board state in a strategic sense (that also makes thematic sens!) and not the player scores/money.

The alliance system also seems rather shallow to me - it'a very binary. You make an alliance or not. And then you break it or not. It's not as fuzzy and uncertain as it can be in a game of Twilight Imperium or Game of Thrones.

The upgrade cards are also not very interesting. Some are almost always good (bonus points for fortresses). Some are a gamble (monsters which might win you a region). And some are so specific that if they don't appear at the right time, they are useless (cards with bonuses for Oni or virtues).

Overall after a bunch of plays, I think this is an OK game that's somewhere in between being abstract and thematic and not being very good as either kind. Would not turn down a game of this, but wouldn't go out of my way to play it."

1082,jazontan,8,"I enjoyed playing this. Negotiation is key to winning. It is difficult to win Rising Sun without the aid of another player since factions pieces are so limited and you can't win every single stage in the battle auctions. The battle system is the most unique I've seen in a dudes on the map game. You don't roll dice or play cards for attacks, but rather you auction for each stage of a battle. The money you paid to ensure you win the battle is then passed on to another player giving them advantages in future battles. The clan asymmetry also makes each game very different. I really enjoy this game."

Like Blood Rage, the winning strategy is maxing out scoring from card-combos, and the huge miniatures (if you can have such a thing) add very little to the game."

1112,jhoughto123,8,"Impression after one play, may change after subsequent plays.

Game was a bit long with 5 players, but may be shorter after repeat plays. However gameplay was very solid with lots of interesting decisions to make. Combat turns into an interesting puzzle in trying to predict what your opponent want to bid on, and then deciding what you should bid on to either win, or lose and get the most points while doing so. Combat rarley felt like there was an obvious solution on what was the best thing to do.

However, some issues with the game were a lengthy rules explanation and a snowball effect where we had one player fall behind and struggle to catch back up. Also, the clan I played as (Lotus) felt weaker with more players,  as there was less options to use their ability.

Overall though very enjoyable. Prehaps not as good as Blood Rage, but still great and there is lots of variation available to keep the game fresh."
1113,jihoon9303,1,I would rather upgrade my Agricola with fancy worker figures than playing this trash with fancy figures.
1114,Jim Marshall,9,"One play only, which we all loved. High expectations (I'm a Blood Rage fanboy) are thankfully meet in a more considered, strategic package with alliances, action selection, purchasable power-ups and a fantastic combat system that uses money in a fantastic way to link all of each round's battles together. You may win one fight by bidding money generously, but if it leaves your coffers empty for the next one you may well come unstuck.

You may have noticed that it looks pretty good, too. Which never hurts."
1115,jimmyclarke87,7.5,"I like and enjoy this game, but it rarely hits the table.
 - Production, components, etc. (KS) are excellent.
 - Great colours and table presence.
 - Fun and exciting battle mechanism (allocating coins to the different options).
 - Potentially a little quick for it's own good as you don't get many turns and there's so much to do. I want those cards and that monster, but I should probably build a turtle, but then again I gotta move if I want to win some territories...
 - I like the alliance mechanic, however it's a little sucky for the remaining player if you play with an odd number of players.
 - Great variability in the cards + monsters, but I can't help but feel like it's missing something."
1116,JimmyNi,5,"To much luck for my taste. In the last game I could not build more than 2 strongholds, there was no way at all.

Beeing in a alliance will in 99% of the time give you grate advantage. Yes, If you is not in a alliance you could use traiter more freely but its not even close to the advantage a alliance will give you, So in a 5 player game at least 1 will not be in a alliance. 

I player that is not in alliance the entire game can however still win but that is only becouse he could get lucky and find for example a  overpowered monster that will turn the entire game.

It feels like they have worked hard to get a good balance but a game that offers so many diffrent abillities where some is REALLY strong there will always be problems.

The scoring cards will be show only in the last season of the game, all you can hope for is that the correct scoring cards for the clan you build shows up.

The game feels like it sells more on hype and over produced components then the core mechanics."

Though the board itself provides many options, if playing a full 4/5 player game, the social game is crucial due to the number of mandates you actually get to choose.

1187,juuzzom,3,"There are some good things in this game. Freedom of movement, almost transparent asymmetry and in principle the action selection mechanism are positives. The action selection mechanism is unfortunately also the Achilles' Heel of the game. The follow actions really make Rising Sun drag badly. The Train action is the worst offender here while also providing a too open way to bring upgrades to your tableau. Combat round then keeps on pushing the game time even further. With all this the game is just too slow moving and swingy for what it offers. Production values are also somewhat off. Color scheme doesn’t help playing and art is unattractive. Miniatures are nice, but don’t really fit on the map making it crowded and messy. I assume this could theoretically be a lot more pleasant experience with lesser amounts of players."
1188,JVallerand,8.5,"The Alliances mixed with the Lead-and-Follow from Puerto Rico are really cool, and I like the upgrade cards, but where this game really shines is the combat system. Having to give the money you spend to people you beat, to then fight them in another province right after, makes decisions excruciatingly hard. 

Like other CMoN games, I'd rather it have tokens, or chits, or cubes, and cost 40$ and fit on a regular table, but oh well."

1193,Kaballeroluna,9,"I was worry about how the negotiation mechanic will work in the game , and it is quite round , I am not a fan of the ""negotiation"" games because at the end everything turns around it , but in this game we have just a little taste of it , enough to have it but not consumed by it. 

The best thing of this game is the ""Puerto Rico"" motor of the game (one player choose an action , every player does it also ) , it was so clever done , that fedback with the alliance system fits perfectly.  

Also I enjoyed a lot with the ""auction"" mechanic for solving the battles. Still you know you are going to lose a battle , you can take advantages with it . Really, It was a great surprise.

I have to give the Designer a big applause for creating this game.

The thing is this game is overproduced, it is not bad per sé , the enjoyment with the detailed of the ""minis"" seems better. But it takes a long time (15 min.) to set up the game , and more to pick it up. However , I recommend this game , also if you like it and you have not played Puerto Rico , give it a try."

1196,Kaizen Zanshin,6,"The models are absolutely gorgeous. Some of the gameplay fighting mechanisms are thematically off for me though. I think that however many Bushi you use in a fight have to stay there. They don't get to run across the board and fight fresh in a new battle while the people who hired them go and kill themselves again and again. That and you don't get to take monsters hostage. ""Okay Gozilla your coming with us! - Godzilla: what this? The guy who brought me into this didn't put his money in the right place or didn't have enough? Okay""... and he walks away with the enemy soldiers. It makes no thematic sense. Other those two things it's a rather good game."

This game is remarkably uninteresting.  I found it slow, there are long period where you are uninvolved in anything that is happening.

I can see loads of variety and strategic depth and mind games here, this is going to be played a lot.

Edit: Played it a couple more times now and my first impression still stands. This is absolutely outstanding. It definitely plays better at 4+ players than at 3, so I would consider that when buying it. Turned out that my regular play group prefers the quick and more casual playstyle of Blood Rage, but for me this is still the go-to competitive game right now. The lengthy planning and not always obvious scoring mechanisms definitely might turn some people off that prefer simpler games."

I don't feel alliances and negotiations, they seem artificial to me, although maybe I will get them better after more plays. It seems like you might have too little control over what you can do. Maybe it's where the negotiations come but I don't know. The battle mechanism is great - the best part of the game. Outcomes are often unexpected and exciting. The harvest action for not allied factions - one coin - is lame and disappointing and somehow much worse than others like marshall or recruit."

The actions are determined by the other players and when it's your turn, you only get to do the mandate that you drew, which may or may not be what you needed. Not a fan of the blind bidding combat as essentially it's the players with the most coins who win. Monsters are intimidating but can just be taken hostage making them worthless (again player with most coins win). The game plays like a snail when compared to its older sibling Blood Rage. At no point in the game did I feel any tension except when in combat with another player who had the exact same number of units and coins as you. That's when I feel like the game shined but that was such a rare occurrence I would just rather play another dudes on a map game."

At 5 players the game can be very long. Lots of downtime.
Some factions can easily snowball while some can be easily denied. So there are some balance issues.
But there are certainly some very good mechanics. The combat is very intriguing.

Althouth i found the game to be very frustrating most of the time - you're constantly getting your plans ruined, losing something, getting denied of something you want. So it's very hard to achieve the strategy you had in mind."

You must have at least three people and four is almost excessive.  Three is the perfect number and it is hard to find two other people who really like this type of game. 2) There are way to many special rules for all the monsters and players. It is impossible to keep track of all the special abilities and since the other players cards are across the table, you just can't keep track of everything and that impacts your strategy.  Once you play this game about 10 times, you will realize this game is a masterpiece.  Your only problem will be trying to find two others to play it that many times.  "

1246,Kharn85,6.25,"Plays: 1

Game components look amazing! The miniatures are well sculpted and dynamic. But has virtually no value to the game, the game is definitely over produced. Huge monsters fight like little armies. Combat is wonky and may require more than one play to grasp the strategy. But the person who won the game, killed all of their own people every battle for the victory points then had poems written about it for even more victory points.  Game play is typical ""eurosnob"", very abstract and area control/denial which seems very out of place for the time period and setting. Combat is mostly who has more people numbers game with an interesting bidding mechanic that I'm not entirely sure is working as intended as mentioned from the point above about suiciding armies. Overall, was enjoyable and I would play again."
1247,Kibbu,8,"1 partida.

Juego de conquista de territorios, en el que se pueden hacer alianzas, en las batallas hay pujas ocultas y cada clan tiene unas habilidades especiales.

El juego está muy bien, con una calidad de componentes brutal, incluyendo miniaturas impresionantes.

Le pongo 2 aspectos negativos a destacar:
- Depende de la zona donde empieces en el mapa, tendrás más o menos oportunidades (por ejemplo yo empecé en un sitio donde solo podía moverme a 1 terreno adyacente, mientras que otras zonas te permitían mover hasta a 5 terrenos diferentes...). En ese sentido no está nada equilibrado.

1248,KickingToken,6.45333,"This week my gaming friends and I got in a three player game of Rising Sun. We enjoyed it. It may not have set our world on fire, but we didn’t set it on fire either. Trust me games have brought me to this point. Eric Lang did a good job of working some interesting mechanics in and the honor track and the way wars are fought did give me the feeling like I had to consider things from a “Art of War” perspective. 
The Art was stylist and gave a very Japanese vibe to the play area. My only negative to this would be is at a quick glance the field can get lost. Maybe if the background art wasn’t as saturated it would make the map stand out just a bit more. That’s just my feelings though. 
The minis are your typical CMON style of mini with great details. I could only find minor issues. Such as bent staffs and a couple small cracks. I look forward to painting them soon. 
My group uses a 5 point scale when we rate games and it averaged out at a 3. This may go up with future plays. The beginning season was a bit of groping around in the dark. We did very little negotiating nor did anyone want to make an alliance. We also felt that the game would be best played with 4 players. "

1287,kradmehr,9.5,"The game, its art and also components are exceptionally gorgeous. The theme implementation is also spot on, but the game doesn't play very good with three. A four player game is the sweet spot, as the downtime would be minimized, and no one would remain without an ally.
The combat mechanic is thoroughly thought-out and very intriguing, and can get quite intense in scenarios with multiple battles happening.
What I despise in this game is its potential for brutality towards other players. Players can easily gang up on a potential runaway leader and make the game the very opposite of a good time.
The game is at it's best when one tries only to enjoy the game and do what his heart desires (i.e. recruiting monsters, playing aggressively, etc.), not paying attention to optimizing his Card Tableau or increasing his victory points.

***UPDATE MAY 2020***
Bumped my score up to 9.5. If played with the right group the game is an absolute brightly shining delight. The Tea Ceremony, alliances and it's potential and the negotiation aspect of it (with promises, deals and everything) takes the game to a whole new level, the likes of which I've never experienced in any other boardgame.
The only downside IMO is the scoring system; if you base your strategy wholly around maximizing your score, chances are you're having less fun than everybody else."
1288,krakrs,9.5,"03-11-2018 - Man, I really dig this game a lot!  I love that you can do poorly, but still do well.  I played the Yellow faction and never won a single battle.  In fact, I killed myself before every one I think!  I still managed to win though.  Really great choices and the blind battle bidding gives me an edge-of-my-seat ""am I doing the right thing?"" feeling like I haven't had since Biblios.  The people I played with were fun people, but the GAME was just fun.  I bought it, KS exclusives included, the day I first played (and it wasn't cheap).  Really dig it.  9.5 just because I'm worried I'm in some strange honeymoon phase, I really am leaning more towards a 10."
1289,Kreyke,9,"Beautiful miniatures by CMON, games can vary a lot, depending on players. In some games, there were hardly any season cards/monsters purchased whereas the map was covered in monsters in other games. 

My favorite expansion would be the Kami pack which changes the game a lot, placing more emphasis on the gods. Dynasty invasion adds more clans. Overall, a nice game to play, relatively easy to teach. Game averages 2.5-3 hours. 

Only downside to the game is that during political phase, there are only 7 turns. In 5-6 player games, majority of players only get 1 turn during the game which makes advanced planning difficult. If you're unlucky and do not get a stronghold out, the recruit mandate essentially does nothing for you. This places an importance on players who get double turns and it's important to persuade them to be your ally."

1292,KrisVerbeeck,8.5,"Ok. i rate this on how much i enjoyed playing this.
Rising sun is a fairly light area majority game. in which player needs to acquire resources (money and ronin) 
The game can be completely overthrown by a player who doesnt know what he is doing and taking suboptimal actions and even disastrous ones even for himself.
This was the case in our game. which handed the victory to one player..

However strangely enough i am totally fine with it. Since that means war was fought between three equally capable opponents.  
But it will be strange if he decides to fight like that the next time.
In the first round he did below par plays for his partner. In the second round he did disastrous plays for his partner and himself
In the third round he only did plays for his partner.

He scored 14 points...

Other scores were 62,54 and 48.
knowing that the ten extra bonus could have gone to the 48 player imstead of the 62r if it wasnt for his action that had absolutely no effect on him. you know where i am getting at.. He did it without talking even. he made up his mind he was going to help him to victory 

So we had a three lords and a bum fighting in this one,

The clans forces are wonderfully. and it doesnt appear to unbalance the game.
It does take some skill to use your clans forces optimally but it easy enough to gain some advantage of them straight away.

Clean up time was a bit long after the game :-)"
1293,Kromlek,8,"Blind bidding in combat is fun, offers a few surprises during the game but usually you can tell what will be bid on based on player strategies.

Season cards are interesting and have lots of different combos that can be built.

All factions have crazy special abilities which is cool
Ronin are kind of unsatisfying in that they just sit there more as a deterrent. They don't become useful often enough for my taste. Especially with koi clan when most players may have 1-5 ronin, koi can always outbid you.

Big minis that really don't do much. Units count as 1 force, leaders don't get captured. Big monsters that have 1 small special ability or modifier. (Shogun just uses cubes to the same effect as the main bushi here).

Up to the players to make negotiating deals more of the game. It's not really pushed by the mechanics other than the ally bonus.

Puerto Rico meets Blood Rage? Tedious and overly long area majority with ingenious battle mechanism. The game looks either somewhat bland (with basic resources) or strongly overproduced (with Daimyo box components). The whole game is straightforward and counter-intuitive and opaque at the same time. Do I even know whom to make an alliance with? Its saving grace is the resolution of battles where, if you have enough money, you can win more points than the actual winners of the battles, which interestingly puts a question mark on the importance of the area majority part. Is area majority really that important (scoring 10/20/30 points for at least 3/5/7 battles won at game end) when you can get cards scoring you 9/12 points in the third year and in each battle you can get a few points for seppuku and from imperial poets?

1308,Lagomorph,5.9,"Yet another game in the predictable Eric Lang formula series (Chaos in the Old World, Blood Rage, Godfather), all of which feature area control, simplistic Cosmic-Encounter combat, extremely tactical play where board states change dramatically between turns with little opportunity for long-term strategy, expendable model figurines which die and are re-summoned constantly, and a power/upgrade drafting mechanic to marginally differentiate your faction from the others.

Rising Sun (RS) 'fixes' my biggest complaint about Blood Rage - the runaway winner/fallaway loser snowballing problem and the ""win more"" battles that punish losers not only with loss of board presence, but also by permanently strengthening the victor. We see numerous game mechanics introduced to balance this major flaw in Blood Rage. Area control rewards (""Harvest"") are now divorced from the battle mechanic, and losers now receive consolation from winners in the form of ALL the coins spent in the battle. In this way, Lang continues to tweak his Cosmic Encounter combat system to be more and more like Cosmic Encounter, introducing the ""Negotiate"" card in its most obvious form yet via the Seppuku action in battle, coupled with the receipt of coins from the winner.

Despite the rulebook emphasizing negotiation throughout, we did almost none. Even the alliance mechanic, which seemed neat at first, became a disappointment, as even when there appeared to be a player who was far ahead of everyone, nobody was willing to forego the substantial benefits of an alliance to leave the winning player out of the alliance.

By the end of the game, it all seemed silly to me. Players would amass huge armies of Gods, Monsters, and Samurai, looking spectacular on the board with their magnificent sculptures - and the battle? Well, one, or both players usually would simply commit mass-suicide before the battle even begins and write a poem about it, to ""lose"" the battle deliberately, which, in our game, would grant double or even triple the victory points than the ""winner"" of the battle received. This is so deeply strange and counter-intuitive that it bothered me. It was just too weird and abstract for my taste...

The components and art were breathtakingly beautiful and high-quality (we played with Kickstarter improvements). A real joy to touch and look at.

After Blood Rage, I swore off buying Lang games. After playing RS, I think I'll avoid playing them from now on too. They're all the same, they don't improve on Cosmic Encounter (Scythe being a by-far better area control game with Cosmic Encounter combat), and the suicide mechanics he built into Blood Rage and RS are just too weird and counter-thematic for me. Lang's games are just overrated, even though they're beautiful. He needs some fresh ideas."
1309,Lahsbee,6,"Gorgeous game!  Unfortunately, the big cool miniatures are not usually the best use of your resources.  Playing your opponents is as or more important than playing the game - there are much, much cheaper and less fiddly ways to get that experience.

I really wanted to like Rising Sun.  Eric Lang has done and is doing some great work.  Should probably just grit my teeth and find a copy of Chaos in the Old World before it hits 4 figures on the secondary market.

Me gusta la asimetría inicial, la mecánica de elección de acciones, los turnos múltiples y el concepto de ""harvest"" para incentivar mayorías intermedias y evitar que sea puro posicionamiento para la guerra. Mucho más estratégico que táctico pero en circunstancias puntuales hay que reaccionar o buscar un plan B. Lo mejor es el sistema de batalla con pujas secretas.

Great gorgeus dudes-on-a-map game... Because of the interaction between Players, because of the experience it has to offer and because of the high quality of components (KS version). I understand that it can be quite cruel and demotivating if all the anger goes to a single player and he can´t do anything profitable during the course of the game. VERY dependent on the players. I like the initial asymmetry, the action selection, the piggyback actions, and the concept of ""harvest"" to encourage intermediate majorities and prevent it from being pure positioning for war. Much more strategic than tactical but in specific circumstances you have to react or look for a plan B. I love the battle system with secret bids. Very original, tense and fun to speculate with what the enemy will do. Playable at 3 and perhaps very chaotic at more than 4. I think 4 players is is better. 5 if you play fast."

1324,LaxPhi,8,"Konnte ich bis lang nur einmal spielen und das auch gleich mit volle Besetzung. Ich finde es grafisch top und passend. 
Ich mag die Idee am Anfang einer jeden Jahreszeit um die Allianzen zu schachern, hängt hier aber stark von den Mitspielern ab, ob groß was geht. Ich weiß nicht mehr wer es gesagt hat aber ich finde die Bemerkung passend: Wenn man nicht schnell genug war fühlte man sich wie in der Disko wenn das Licht angeht und man nimmt was überbleibt. Ist mir zum Glück nicht passiert, da ich es geschafft hatte immer gleich vor der eigentliche Phase auch eine Allianz zu finden und hier auch einen gefühlten Minuspunkt im Spiel und zwar der starke Startspieler Vorteil. Ich sehe den Festungsbau direkt an Anfang als sehr stark an und wenn man entsprechend seine Allianzen schmiedet kann man in der 2. Jahreszeit schon alle gebaut haben. Ebenfalls haben die anderen Spieler keine Möglichkeit wenn es doof läuft nach dem 2. Spieler noch Festungen zu bauen. War bei meinen einen Spiel leider so verteilt, kann sich natürlich relativieren wenn die Aktionen anders gemischt werden. Die Auflösung bei Gleichständen finde ich okay, denn in Regelfall sind die Unehrenhaften Aktionen stark um den Ausgleich zu schaffen. Das Kampsystem finde ich gelungen, erinnert natürlich an Cyrisis (?), was ich leider bis heute nicht einmal voll spielen konnte. Was komisch Empfand ist das gefangen nehmen der riesigen Monster, was dessen Besitzer fast dazu zwing sehr viel Geld zu investieren um das zu verhindern, dass diese Überhaupt wirken. Wegen den Blancing der Clans kann ich noch nicht so sehr viel sagen. Natürlich wirken einige Clans stärker als die anderen aber um das vollkommen ab zu schätzen würde ich es gerne nochmal spielen."
1325,LazyRobot11,9,"An excellent successor to Blood Rage that carries a bit of the same feel, while also managing to stand out. This one finds its uniqueness in the delivery of its mechanisms with 3 well defined phases that feel different and tense from the start. The player powers hold quite a bit of depth hidden just beneath the surface, and the game urges you to dig just a bit further every play. Area control and action selection at its finest, and the beautiful figures certainly don’t hurt. Don’t worry about “missing out” on the Kickstarter, give this one a shot for sure!"
1326,lebryant,8,"It has been on my wishlist to play for over a year but it has always eluded me until I finally got a chance to play and it did not disappoint. It's very engaging - you're doing something during most players' turns. Although it's evident that the downtime could be an issue. Variable factions feel truly unique to each other and provide a nice starting strategy. However, there's little flexibility to deviate from this strategy if you were to score well. Production is beautiful, very unique colors to a boardgame and monster miniatures are eye gazing. Combat mechanics could seem strange at first, but when you realize it's not really a combat-focused game and more concentrated on resource management and action blocking, the overall combat feels really fitting. However, it is not all sunshine under the Rising Sun! I couldn't care too much about alliances. It did not feel engaging enough, was more like ""hey, would you like an alliance?"", ""sure, I guess so ..."". You can also be out of the game very early. It is almost impossible to catch-up if other players play it right."
1327,leebo33,7,"This is a really good game with interesting mechanics.  I especially enjoyed the war phase selection.  However, the negotiation aspect fell flat with my group, especially with three players.  One player was usually behind and ended up helping to ""king make"" the winner or simply chose not to form an alliance out of fear of upsetting another player. This game is probably a solid 9 in the right group, but for me it was worth selling when the value was high.  My family much prefers Blood Rage where it is more ""every man for himself"" and the games (at least for us) were much shorter."

Pros:
- Great combat system
- Role selection mechanic ensures that you don't get bored even when the game can take up to 5 hours. You always have something to discuss, think about and do
- The alliance mechanic gives a nice frame to the diplomacy aspect
- The clan powers are very different, but the game still feels rather balanced
- Fun combos with season cards, monsters, shrines and clan powers

Cons:
- Box should say 4-5 players, 3p is rather meh
- Retail version feels like half a game (content-wise, I don't mind the components)
- Setup and teardown is a nightmare
- Easy to fall behind early with low honor clans if there's no Amaterasu

Next time I want to try  game with 4 players, because I am still curious about this game."
1352,littlechandler,7,"Initial impressions: I thought I didn't like negotiation games and this game's spiritual inspiration was supposedly Diplomacy, but that I didn't mind the negotiation here and in Inis makes me think that maybe I just don't like them in party games and when someone uses it to just play really chaotically. Alliances, timely betrayals, and supposed alliances but actually just taking of advantage of alliances definitely seem like they can be powerful in this game, but it isn't like you can go frm sharing a great board state with another player to them next turn wiping you off the map.

This seems to share a lot of similarities with Blood Rage, namely that the mythological themes don't seem to be that well integrated (the fact that one monster is named after a faked wikipedia entry is especially bad here), but the multiple combos and strategies you can employ makes me like both games anyways (but for some reason I am rarely in the mood to play either. I've given up two oppportunities to play this again since writing this). In particular, the dimensions you have to consider simultaneously the benefits of having high honor vs. tanking your honor, the area control (through the gods and harvest actions), winning battles at the end vs. getting immediate points from seppuku and battle poets, which regions people want more, and which actions to boost via cards and strongholds. Like Blood Rage there are the mind games of what people are going to play for in battles, even moreso here, and also like Blood Rage losers lose all their units, but winner pays a higher price that makeit easier to win future battles in the same round. Like Blood Rage there is a win by losing strategy which I like, but for people who don't I think it is easier to remove the clans and powers that combo with such a strategy. Like Blood Rage minis are way too overproduced for what they convey and in that actually kind of detract from the theme for me due to the schism, but otherwise the visual design of both games are excellent to help convey information easily. Like Blood Rage I think some cards some people will think are unbalanced either too weak or strong (moreso in Blood Rage), but presumably over time the depth of the game systems will be revealed to show additional combos to boost the ""weak"" cards and counter the ""strong"" ones. Like Blood Rage some of the ways to score feel a little arbitrary and not thematically tied. Like Blood Rage if people don't evaluate threats correctly someone can run away with the game.

Some big positives this game has over Blood Rage is that each clan has very unique and powerful abilities right off the bat, the mechanism that is unique to it in the Puerto Rico-like variable phase order is interesting and is more thematic than the unique mechanism of Blood Rage of drafting of cards, and it can play 5 without extra content. Some big negatives compared to Blood Rage is that combats are at the end of each season only drains a lot of the spontaneity that added more tension and excitement throughout each round, and its money economy doesn't feel as smooth, with many periods of famine in between sporadic bursts of income and big swings based on how much people value certain regions during the wars, compared to the hand management and rage action point allowance in Blood Rage.

EDIT: Ugh I thought the long playtime of my first game was due to one guy being pretty distracted, but my second game was just as long."

1361,Lofski,9.5,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Also a good blend of fun times and deep strategy, and has lots of replayability (at least for KS version). The game is pretty gorgeous visually, especially the art by Adrian Smith.

There are 3 problems I have with the game though:

#1 is that there are tons of opportunities for accidental king making, and they can be very hard to avoid. For example, should you pick train mandate and a card that isn't great for you or let the next player have it and win the game with it? The tools for diplomacy in the game don't seem to be enough to handle those situations.

Related to the previous point, the 2nd issue is that the card balance is a bit off. A lot of the cards are just a waste of space and potential, while some are extremely strong for their cost.

The 3rd is that many cards and clan abilities from the Dynasty expansion are sloppily written, and the official rulings available are lacking."

1371,lordvoldemort,9,"An amazing game by Eric Lang.  In this game, it has area control, you form alliances, select actions that give you and your ally a special ability and all others get to perform that action too.  You have god actions that also occur at various stages which can give you money, extra actions, abilities but all are randomized and have a very interesting order.  This all builds up to a war.  Combat is interesting in that all persons in the province participate, you secretly bid on suicide, taking prisoners, using ronin, or writing about the battle.  You can gain points from most of these or from winning the battle you get the province token.  The more of those you acquire the more points you get at the end.  Outthinking your opponents is a big element of this.  The winner pays money to the losers of the battle so that is a way to earn more money in the war phase.  You play over three ages and new cards come out each which give you special abilities if you train using them.  There is much more to the game.

I love this game.  It is a spiritual successor to Blood Rage, but it does have some more complexity than Blood Rage.  You can see some mechanics that are similar but it is a different game.  I am very happy to own it and I really love it.  I am giving it a 9 right now but I can easily see this as a 10.  "

Painfully few opportunities to choose actions (sometimes just once per round).  The similarity of the cards to Blood Rage are frustrating when you realize you will not get many chances to actually purchase and use them.  I'd rather play a 2-player bluffing combat game like Shazamm! than a 2-3 hour game that is largely based on the same mechanic when it comes down to it.  If as much time was spent making meaningful connections between mechanics and theme as was spent on designing the components, this could be a great game.  As it is, it looks better on the shelf."

10/2019  The plastic-fantastic looks are decieving.  It's a good area influence strategy game underneath. (Rating up to 8)

Rising Sun is a game of area control with phenomenal minis by Adrian Smith, much like its older brother Blood Rage. It is very similar in multiple aspects. No card draft, cards are purchased during a specific action, and actions are selected out of a choice of 4 drawn tiles, making the game more unpredictable with dependency on alliances. It is a nice game but may be too similar to Blood Rage for casual fans of the genre to own both, and if you do, pick Blood Rage, which is more to the point.

EXTREMELY gorgeous minis. Some of the very best I have ever seen."
1412,Madmallows,8.5,"I had a lot of fun playing this game for the first time recently. The variety of strategy is excellent; I loved that each clan had a slightly different approach to purchasing cards, building strongholds and moving on the board. The Honor system was really great and a few battles were determined by that alone. 

Production: 10/10. Everyone who played commented on how well everything looked and the figures are excellent. Personally, I also really, really liked how the season cards vary between play sessions of the game. I feel like that creates replay value for me. Additional, I felt like this is a unique area for custom house rules: you can create, combine, and sort through the season cards for super original seasons if you want. (E.G. using all of the monsters in the game or having a season more weighted with War cards). -Of course this is probably a little imbalanced but nonetheless, I feel as if it mixes up the game over time. 

The negotiation aspect went over really well for my group and worked out best for everyone. I was a little skeptical of both the alliance system and negotiation system, but it faired much better in the end.

This game is physically large and does require a big table. It does take a while to setup and tear down, however, it was expected and it's not a big deal to myself.

Lastly, the KS exclusives are really great and it is a shame that they will not be coming to retail. I would prefer if these exclusive figures and alternative play styles come later as expansions. 

Overall, super great game. I enjoy this play style primarily because I loved Blood Rage and this is no different. Lots of strategy, lots of fun putting big dudes on a board."

After two games I can't tell for sure if the game is balanced, but personally I feel like every clan has its unique ability that is useful in different situations. I really like the negotiations, we've had a blast while forming alliances. Each God is worth the praying and each monster can be devastating in certain situations. Needless to say, I am overwhelmed and I can only praise the game. I am curious to see whether my opinion will change after more plays - my only concern is truly about how balanced the game is. Components are obviously excellent but I would enjoy this game even with paper components because of its great gameplay."

Original play: I like diplomacy and I like dudes on a map games. I did not feel that diplomacy or combat was relevant, because of all the season card sugar that could not be interacted with through those routes. The season cards felt like the main game, where getting the right ones completely dominated other methods of getting victory points.  Worse, the core catchup mechanics of the game, alliances and diplomacy, where absolutely powerless to interact with someone on the season card victory.

1431,malloc,7,"Seems good. certainly better than Blood Rage. Not enough plays to know if there is some crazy combo that is too strong or needs to be played around.

2 plays in and you certainly need to be careful on adding in expansions. We tried the Kami expansion with mixed reviews. I liked that the temples meant more but some of the gods were really strong. 

Also I am not so sure i like open coin and ronin information before battle. Most of our battles were pre negotiated (I like this) but the ability to really surprise anyone is limited by them knowing exactly what you have. 

Placing 7 tiles in a 6 player game felt wrong. Player 1-3 have a lot more control over the game than 4-6. especially if the 1st two guys ally each turn. 

Also not being able to do something to break other people alliances seems like a miss.

1445,marcss,7.8,"+ The rule book is fantastic. it's an easy read and explains all the important parts of the game with helpful examples and illustrations. The lay out is near perfect and the inclusion of some of Adrian Smith's amazing art is always welcome. The reference on the back provides just enough information to keep the game moving smoothly.

+ The rules are simple but they offers a lot of strategy. A season consists of a few phases: Players get income, reveal the provinces that will be at war at the end of the season and players will make alliances. Then, the active player chooses a mandate action which allows them to recruit, move, train, harvest or betray while the other players follow the selected action, sometimes with a less effective version. Area control at the temples is checked a few times during the season and offers benefits to the leader of each. The season ends with resolving battle in 5-8 provinces. Do that three times and the game ends. The complexity is in playing with and against the other players, forming alliances, breaking alliances, sowing seeds of discontent in rival alliances, and so on. 

+ The follow mechanism combined with the alliance bonuses is great and offers compelling reasons to create, break, or even avoid an alliance depending on who's the next player, which cards are available, which temples are available, the wars that will be fought at the end of the season, and the current state of the board. It's incredibly important to pay attention to turn order.

+ The area influence at the temples adds an agonizing decision between adding more force to the provinces or getting special benefits from the temples that will help you in other ways.

+ The honor system offers legitimate reasons to be both high and low at different times throughout the game requiring you to make painful sacrifices (maybe a high honor will help win a critical tie at the temple, but it will also mean your Oni contributes much less force to a battle.) With more plays I'll be curious if players will benefit from going all-in one way or the other.

+ The battle system is really interesting and puts you in control. There's no random number generator determining your success or failure. You need to plan your battles carefully taking into consideration how much force, money, and reinforcements your opponents have at their disposal, and what is motivating them. There are several options available to you, but you'll need to win a bid for the action you want to perform to benefit from it. When you win, you'll get the war token and when you lose, you'll receive coins from the winner, giving you more options in subsequent battles. A carefully planned loss can be a great option.

+ The additional content -- temples, season cards, clans, and monsters -- promises to add a lot of variability and replay value.

+/- This game is going to make you really question your ability to be friends with certain people. It enables players to do some really terrible things to each other. Plan accordingly.

- While this is certainly a great rule book, I would love to have a card reference which goes into detail on each card since we encountered some nuances that required a bit of discussion and consideration, but they were ultimately worked out after revealing more cards and comparing them with one another."

1486,MegaHamster,9,"This game fits into the category of easy to play, hard to master. Each of the clans has what feels like a game breaking power that makes them super fun and unique to play. The Kami add variety to the game and the honour system is brilliant and superbly thematic. The battles have some incredibly interesting interactions with difficult decisions to be made where you realise having more models in the fight might not win you the war! You must pick your fights as paying your investment in the battle to your opponent as war reparations may leave you bankrupt and your opponent strong for the next battle. 

My only criticism is that we have already found several questions relating to the interactions of various monsters we cannot find answers for in the rules or official FAQs. This is frustrating as it breaks the flow of the game and no official ruling can leave players feeling hard done to if the group decides their power doesn't work how they thought it did. Does not ruin what is a fantastic game. Always a relief when a blingy Kickstarter turns out to also be an incredible game."

Components (from the Daimyo Box replacing the retail components)
Content diversity(area controlling, negotiation, alliances, auctions , clan improvements through the cards, asymmetric factions) Combining all these can lead to different strategies to win the game.

The strategy the clans invoke are interesting and have a nice depth to them. Figuring out how to maximize your advantages or those of others is a welcomed challenge. Negotiation is a subtle inevitability that really rewards those who can manipulate the perception of the board or your next moves. 

The minis are the best sculpts I’ve experienced. They alone are worth the money spent on the game. To compliment the amazing table presence is gorgeous artwork on the components and the board itself. It’s stunning all set up and in play.

Also, this is the kind of game that you have to play with the right people for it to be competitive.  While that's true for other games as well, Rising Sun is not for people who can't hold all the player powers in their minds, as well as the locations, as well as special cards, as well as currency amounts, as well as...you get it.

To make it actually competitive, you need to hand-pick who you play with, and that seems a little too restrictive to me, especially when I know I'm going to have to invest nearly as much time scheduling the play with the right people as I am taking it out of the box."

Loved my 1 play on it. But no one else seemed to. Like the alliance mechanism in this game and the backstabbing that can happen (and associated consequences). Loved the version of the game I played with truly outstanding minis. I really wonder how this game will fare with a few more plays. I am leaving it at a 7 since I am unable to get access to a copy to have further plays on it.

= (6/6/19). Is probably a 6 rather than a 7. Needs a good group for this to be enjoyable. If nothing else, definitely needs a timer on all the negotiation stuff. Will have to re-rate after another play probably. Definitely not moving higher than a 7. Love the war phase and the whole political mandate selection phase mechanics still.

+1 (7/21/19). Stays the same after another play. Starting to feel like things might start feeling differently (for the better) if I get to play this with the same group multiple times.

+1 (7/23/19). Updating this to an 8 after a play of TI4 oddly enough. Let's see if this manages to stay there.

-1 (1/27/20). Reverts back to a 7 as I simply have not missed the game at all. Getting a steady group to play this with is a bit more of a challenge than I originally felt. That the game plays best at 5 is also a bit of a detriment. Also, in retrospect, it feels as if one has less control over one's own fate in this game than in Blood Rage. And that is a bit less to my liking. The heavy reliance on negotiation has not really helped as well."

1. For 100 €. I expect proper packaging. If there is no space for the material this cannot be described as a  good game experience.

PROS
- It's gorgeous. Amazingly beautiful and well-crafted.
- The game isn't difficult to grasp for new players.
- It would be delightful for people who enjoy comboing.

CONS
- The negociation is, in my experience, not decisive at all. The Betray action does not feel like betraying your ally at all, and the overall feeling is not political.
- The game revolves around the card combos, with those being more important than actual area control.
- Winning wars and winning VPs aren't necessarily tied, and actually wars don't feel like the best way to win. This, with the previous point, gives me an ackward sensation when playing it.
- With all the miniatures, the setup time is way longer than needed."

1572,Mozzik,9,"This game is amazing.  It takes everything I like about Blood Rage and drops the things that have made that game hard to get to the table by removing the draft.  This makes the game far more approachable and a snap to teach.

There's an elegance here where fairly few rules and mechanics mesh into a very complex and fascinating puzzle.  All of the asymmetrical powers feel amazing, but don't break the game.  Even the clan I was least interested in (turtle) was the one I ended up playing for my first game and I quickly realized how awesome their mobile strongholds are - largely because the game wants you to conquer new territory each season instead of becoming entrenched and movement is at a premium.

The production values are, of course, top notch.  Played with 4 players and core box only.

Update: These comments reflect a preview play before release.  After release play I've seen more lopsided games where it makes me think this might take a little more time for everyone to pick up than I first assumed, but the open information does make it less intimidating than Blood Rage.

Update: After some more plays I still greatly enjoy this game, though my enthusiasm has started to slump a little bit due to the hefty play time and a growing certainty that it's better at lower player counts.  The monsters are also almost always underwhelming in actual gameplay."

My group didn't like the game for that reason, it was too hard to figure out what's happening who's ahead and who isn't.

I liked it. I think that the feeling of growth you have is really satisfying, especially when you buy a card, recruit units to the board or build a stronghold.

An attractive game, no doubt. Color palette was well chosen.

I have seen comparisons of this game to Diplomacy, but that is over-reaching. Negotiations are an important factor in the game, but they are limited in scope. And like Diplomacy, negotiations are not binding.

Game is weighted to having an alliance between two players so as to take fuller advantage of the mandates selected. This means that in games with an odd number of players, someone may be left in the cold. Although they can perform the Betrayal mandate without penalty.

I REALLY enjoyed the combat system. Misdirection and bluff play significant roles. Not to mention that ""winning"" every battle can be quite costly as you must compensate your opponents...that can add up quickly.
You may ""lose the battle and the territory"", yet win VPs in spite of that.

We completed a six player game in under four hours with only one experienced player. Game moves more smoothly as players get comfortable and negotiate the subtle, multifaceted strategies of the game.

Enjoy this one!!"

That said, a second game with 4 players felt a lot more balanced, though some specific season cards do throw that balance off. I feel there is no clear-cut way to win the game, which is good since you can concentrate on paths different from your adversaries, but experience will always benefit you.
Still need more playing to make a final decision in terms of rating.

If i had to make comparisons, the overall feel of the game is a bit like Twilight Imperium/Rex, with better flow (and no ending betrayal shenanigans like TI).
I end up feeling like Scythe is a better overall game, but i'm quite enjoying Rising Sun, and i do love the minis."

However, I played 3 games of this, with variable player counts (3; 6; 5) and every time I felt like I did not have enough control over my own fate. So much happens between your turns, and even when you *get* a turn, the RNG in the deck (or simply the choices of the people before you) can lead you to not have a good action anyways. It's a very nice ""experience"" and it can be fun in it's own way, but definitely NOT as a competitive game. Best way to play is to literally ignore the point track.

There is a lack of catch-up mechanics (specially in an even number of players) and kingmaking in the game end. Those are serious defects in a 2018 game.
I hated the war phase. In the last turn, I managed to defeat a dragon with one single soldier, because my opponent was out of coins. That was ridicolous, and thematically pointless.
If you are planning to buy the game, you should also know that YOU CAN'T HAVE some of the expansions, because they are kickstarter exclusives. But do yourself a favor and don't buy it, there are much better games like Cry Havoc, Kemet, Scythe, if you like this kind of games.

After 4 plays, this game WAY surpassed my expectations.  GREAT minis AND game play.  Very cool monsters (Oni) and abilities that can be purchased in game.  Ways to gain and lose honor along with the benefits / consequences of doing so. Probably the best game I've played with ""alliances"" and ""negotiation"".  Rules are pretty straightforward, but the amount of manipulation / maneuvering, and room for ""smart"" and ""exciting"" play (without dice) is quite impressive.  In my book this will easily be in the BGG top 10.  Asymmetric powers that seem strong, but not overpowered, and game seems quite balanced.

In execution, however, it doesn't quite reach the heights that the design suggests. That isn't to say that this is a bad game. On the contrary, Rising Sun is a very good game. If one great thing could be said about it, it's that the action selection mechanism is one of the most tense and difficult choices you make during the game. That being said, I can't help but compare this to Blood Rage. I feel like this is a more refined design, but it doesn't have the sheer fun that BR does. I also played Lords of Hellas around the same time, which ended up being head and shoulders above this one. So while I really enjoy Rising Sun, it sits in an uncomfortable third rung from those aforementioned titles when it comes to hybrid area control games."

Why bother deploying troops when you can just win an area battle with an insane power or monster? On the subject of monsters, what is the thematic rationale for a gigantic Godzilla monster being taken hostage? Stellar production value makes players overlook mediocre game play in my opinion . Would rate it lower but I suspect the game plays better with less than six players. I'll amend my rating after I've played it with three or four players.

1674,notnorb,N/A,"Tentative rating: 6/10

Played a 2 hour game with 3 players. The two players who allied early on ran ahead with the extra ally advantages from the mandates. Game degenerated into king making soon after. Rating might change with different player counts, but I'm wary that additional players will just drag the game even longer. 

Game play boils down to BLOOD RAGE's ""dudes on a map,"" mixed in with a PUERTO RICO action/phase selection and a battle system is reminiscent of the bidding/bluffing system of SCYTHE. Messy IMO, but if this sounds like something you're into, RISING SUN is up your alley. 

Production levels of this game are insane. Just don't fall in love with all the bling and miniatures, the strategy in RISING SUN doesn't quite hold up. Combat lacks tension and is more about moves and counter-moves. The honor system trumping every tie in the game makes it easy for runaway leaders.

I really like this game: the mechanics are varied enough to allow quite a few paths to victory (and not just conquest, as I would have expected when I started playing), and you are heavily invested in what the others do (unless you no longer participate in any the remaining battles), as it will end up affecting you.

War phase - it's not supposed to represent real life. And if you think the player with the most coins wins, you're not playing it right.
Monsters - if you feel they aren't valuable enough, then learn how to maximize them. The game is extremely well balanced.

~Replayability not high
~Negotiation and betray mechanic integrate well but still feel weak

-Some mechanic not make sense (Able to put stronghold anywhere on the board, kill all our units by seppuku then capture enemy unit by take hostage but all my unit already dead?)
-Very long for what its deliver
-Too many KS exclusive and the different between retail and KS component
-Rule hard to explain
-player can choose to do action only 2-3 per one game

Overall: Very good hybrid Area Control game to play at 4>>>3>6>5 players count but feel a bit long and not excite when play (except the beauty)"

Having played a number of games so far, a surprising discovery is that new players manage to get into it fast, and even compete for first place. 

Alas the theme doesn't feel too integral to the game, and to be honest the monsters (huge though they are) feel weak."

1703,OlegKlishin,5,"Very long and convoluted, with significant downtime. I found battle system to be interesting, but ultimately still rather random. Why spend 5 minutes on every single battle, when results are that chaotic anyway? This will reward experienced players, but it doesn't pull me in enough to master it's nuances.

I feel that alliances and betrayals as dedicated mechanisms push you too much to use them, and lessen the impact of it happening. Betrayal feels like your averge action instead of a dramatic event. Maybe the problem is in me: as an introverted player I prefer negotiations to be based on board state, not on speculations and sweet tongue.

Also, why buy a 100$ box of miniatures, when your coolest biggest monster can be taken hostage by a single bushi without taking part in battle? Overral it felt like a typical kickstarter marketing ploy. Bombastic presentation, and okay-ish game behind it. Honestly, it's not a bad game, but I'll prefer any other dudes on a map area control over Rising Sun."

I had several misconceptions of the game before playing it. There is not a lot of diplomacy in the game (unless you want it). Tea ceremony is fast and betray doesn't feel personal.

The quality of the miniatures here really make you want to play the game.

The only thing I have against this game is that CMON really screwed up the customer. Unless you got this via Kickstarter, it is impossible to get the whole game in retail, because one of the 8 possible clans was a Kickstarter Exclusive. That gets on my nerves and I probably wouldn't have the game if I hadn't kickstarted it."
1717,OrionHegemony,7,"I don't like the way the alliances work and how there is an odd person out who gets no compensation and no way to join an alliance.  It feels very much like chaotic kingmaking. Also, the rules for the way the cards work are very vague. How the hell did this get published without rules for the cards. Outside of the battle bid mechanic which works very well, there aren't enough decisions that are made. Often only one of the tiles you get will be at all playable and the game just sort of plays itself. Its still very interesting to see how things fall out."

1758,pepitosegrilla,9,"Absolutely genius. This game is a lesson in modern game design. Rules are thematic even when they are not historically accurate, because for the mind of a clueless westener, all the oddities that fill the game feel like feudal Japan. The combat system is the star. It's taken from Cry Havoc, but it's not copied, because it ads quite a bit more to think about, by making bids secret, by making the looser take the bid of the winner (so the winner gets also punished by war), and by sequencing battles in a very clever way, in which even when you were in a bad starting position, you can still outwit the strongest player, and end up as successful. The main phase, in which you prepare for war, and the alliance mechanics are not on par with Bood Rage's, but you play through them so you can get to the next battle."

1760,per42,6.5,"Area Control games doesn't appeal to me and I really dislike negotiation mechanics in games. This game is a good one though, even if it's not really my type of games. I like the unique auctioning mechanics in the War Phase. I like the Puerto Rico-like role based actions. 

The Tea Ceremony could kill the game for me forever, but the few times I have played the game so far I have played with the right people. 30 seconds tea ceremony is enough for me; ""hey, let's be an alliance"", ""ok"", ""then it's just you and me left?"", ""ok"".

But I have seen people leaving the room, negotiating for 15-30 minutes, and not only during the tea ceremony, but also during the political phase. "
1761,PeriklesKwaXulu,9,"So much fun. Different clans give different experiences. Different decks and gods change the game, so even playing the same clan twice can afford quite different experiences. Great combination of different game mechanics."
1762,PermaFrost88,8,"This is an area control game with a negotiation aspect to it.

The powers of the season cards are exciting to collect, and having huge monsters on the board adds flavor and spice.

The war phase has a simultaneous reveal with actions going to the highest bidder of each for each war that occurs. This part of the game becomes a mind game, and it may turn away some players (but not me).

I would not recommend playing at 3 since the odd man out can get hard countered by alliances. Sometimes I wish alliances were not a thing, and that the game would be closer to El Grande.

There are some broken combos that can occur. It is up to the players to find them and prevent them them on future plays either through denial of certain things or allying with a player against them. Repeated plays will balance the game out.

After awhile, the negotiation aspect of this game gets a bit tiring."

1766,PeterRustemeyer,5,I don't get it why CMOn insists on giving me huge miniatures that do nothing interesting.
1767,peteyandycreek,8,"5 Plays - If you are completely mechanics driven, this is a 7/10. The game is visually spectacular though, which really improves the experience! This is an area control strategy game. Not really a dudes on a map experience, even though that's what it looks like. Not really a big negotiation game, despite the claims (though there is some). Nothing really 'new' mechanically, but overall the game is FUN, works very well and is simple to teach and learn. 

My one negative is that there are a lot of cards, which can make determining the 'state of the board' more difficult for newbies and often enough catch out experienced players. Ultimately, it's not fun to play a 2-3hr strategy game, only to have moments where players disappointingly sigh, ""oh, I didn't realize you had a card that gave your leader +3 force/ your monster that ability"". Rising sun is a big game, with lots of components and staring across the table at upside down (to you) cards does not make reading the board status very easy - which is a requirement for making strategic choices.  

To win, generally you need to avoid taking a major bad step for the entirety of the game, making it a fun challenge. This usually happens when you try to control more than what is reasonable/ underestimate the reach of others (particularly those taking actions after you) and instead find your figures trying to seppuku. However, you also need to stretch yourself to win provinces wherever you can - missing out on just one is often the difference between winning and losing. In summary: play too conservatively or too greedily just once and you will likely lose. 

Points are the name of the game and you will need to make sure that whatever you purchase will net you some. Purchasing monsters because you think it will 'help' is not enough. You need to have a specific use and/or province token in mind at the time i.e. you really need a clear purpose for purchasing monster. The same applies with point scoring cards that need to be combo'd well with your future moves, strategies and faction abilities. 

One thing I don't really like about Eric Lang designs is the actually HOW mainstreamed some of them are. All designers walk the line between mainstreaming a game in search for elegance, while risking the elimination of elements that were genuinely really cool. In most miniature Eric Lang games I've played, there is definitely something lost in his designs... the search for elegance seems to leave the game (for me) feeling just a little empty. For Rising Sun, the game at times feels 'too constrained'. Movement is so tight that the whole map feels so connected at all times, yet frustratingly difficult to actually move in a helpful way. Of course this key tension surrounding movement will be a point of praise for many, but for me, it just isn't what I want it to be (and is perhaps more a case of, this isn't what I personally want). In Shogun or Mare Nostrum or Eclipse there is a sense of distance that comes from the map, with parts of it that may be virtually inaccessible - I want that! The game also forces you to do what you're told and I want to be able to forge my own path. Going in knowing the spread of mandates makes for nice strategy, but the mechanic feels so constraining as most of your actions will be chosen by your neighbors, not you! The 1-2 choices you do get, are also limited by your tile draw. The fact that war is brutal is made up for by consolation points through hostage and seppuku, which seems present only because the game doesn't have time to go through the 'up and down' swings of a more rich area control/ conflict game. Essentially, in no way do I feel like a Daimyo overlooking the continent plotting a secret plan to the top - which is quite a 'sandbox' type feeling. Instead, my secret plan is already laid out - in fact most of my plan will be represented by others choosing a mandates and me trying to make the best of their corresponding actions. To top it all off, despite the constrained mechanics the game it still stretches to 3hrs regularly. Perhaps this point is over made in the case of Rising Sun though, as it does still find its place with enough to make it strategic and fun. 

In terms of strategy, this game has you walking on 'eggshells' until the end, hoping that you can avoid that one misstep that will see you trail behind the leader. Your strategy will often hinge on educated predictions rather than exact calculations and this makes for a very tense game, It's a very tight area control game that is visually masterful. While not a battle/ dudes on a map game per se, it is a solid game."
1768,pezpimp,6,"Based on one play: A fairly standard game of battle where you are trying to take over areas on the board with various mechanics such as monsters, warriors and collecting point by various methods including majority, battle victories and special cards. My issue with these Kickstarter games is that they come with so many ""bonuses"" that the basic game gets lost. We played with a few of the expansions on first play and there are just too many powers and options that it gets tedious to track and each players plans fall apart as they are reminded of bonus abilities written on small text cards in front of each player. The game is also way over produced which actually takes away from the game play and makes it hard to see what is going on. I would play again but with a more basic version to get  a better opinion."
1769,pha3drus,10,"Changed from 9 to 10 due to all the annoying nonsense 1's.  I'm quite impressed with the gameplay and mechanics.  Eric Lang knows game design and does it well.  The battle mechanism reminds me of Meleé, which I quite enjoyed. Guessing the amount bid and winning the coins if you lose is a nice balance... the double crossing, good for me=good for you, bribing, whining, extorting, and wheeling/dealing make this a great game! The minis and art just make one slobber. Lots of good stuff here, deep strategy, long term planning of tactics.  This will be a gem in the collection right next to Blood Rage, Cthulhu Wars, and Scythe! Love it!"

1776,Phrim,7,"Rising Sun is a dudes-on-a-map-style combat game that feels a lot like Blood Rage--you perform a bunch of actions to set the stage for a series of battles that happens at the end of each round.  In this case, the actions felt a little like Puerto Rico, in that you choose an action and everyone gets it, but you (as well as an ""ally"" chosen during an open negotiation session) get an additional benefit.  These actions can involve playing or moving troops, collecting resources, and gaining special ability cards with a variety of benefits, including the use of special figures like giant demons.  Battles themselves have a blind bidding mechanic, allowing the winners of four actions to lose their own troops for bonus points, capture the opponent's units, bring in temporary units, and gain points for each unit lost.  The game encourages players to win battles in a variety of different regions, which helps prevent turtling.  While battle games like this aren't really my cup of tea, I thought that this game really executed well on what it wanted to do.  The game felt really dynamic as battles moved across the map and players competed for different areas.  However, the games I've played in haven't involved much of the open negotiation that's allowed in this game--if they did, that would've left a lot more of a sour taste in my mouth.

No one knows really. Will they commit seppuku or not? Some of those things could be predicted to some level but I want more control and less chaotic mess like this game is. I did not like the alliance mechanic either. I would very much like the action selection to be so that one gets the benefit and every one else get to do the smaller part like it is in Puerto Rico/Twilight Imperium/etc. So in short - not a game for me really. Components and artwork are top notch and quite enjoyable to see on the table though. It´s a very stylish looking game."

1789,Pita26,9,"One of my all time favorite games. The clans are all interesting and each seems to have a different winning objective (for example, Fox seemingly wants to utilize Seppuku as much as possible) but there are multiple avenues to victory.

Rules are clear and the gameplay is fairly intuitive. 

Minor quibles : the game takes a little too long and with all the extra abilities players acquire through the cards they buy, the last combat round is a bit overwhelming. Choices = good, too many choices = not so good."

While a variable game setup allows for a unique game experience every time you play, the unconventional scoring system will take some time to get used to and develop long term strategies.

The game mechanics are very clean and easy to learn. However, it is recommended to read up on basic strategies for your clan before playing your first game since it is very easy to hurt yourself playing the wrong way.

I am not a fan of negotiating or the bidding combat system but once you accept these are a part of the game they are easy to look past.

Despite all of this I found the game highly intriguing and wanted to play it again."

1814,primeval,1,Unbalanced game. The game is much longer.
1815,PrimogenGames,7,"Ok, I'll admit I bought this game for the miniatures.  And they alone were worth the price.  CMON did an amazing job pushing the limits of miniatures that come pre-assembled (yay). While the core game does have a limited variety (some miniatures are repeated) I got the expansions which have a ton of other Cool Minis (- Or Not).  

Stepping away from my excitement of the miniatures, the game is actually pretty cool too.  There is a very neat mental game you play with your opponents when betting that you don't see in other games. The unique twists in this game makes it one of a kind, but it also comes with a downside that I didn't pay as close attention to as I should have.

You can ONLY play this game with a minimum of 3 players!  Not 1, not 2, but 3.  The very limited range of player count options makes this game a difficult one to get out and play.  My wife and I tried to make up a way to play with two players and you can't.  It just isn't the same, it just doesn't work.  We played with two players each which was ok for learning the game, but just didn't cut it for more than one time.  So I've only played this game a couple times with friends.

If I found a game with unique betting mechanics and amazing miniatures like this game, but that could be played with... say 1-6 players I'd rate it a 9 out of 10 easily.  This game would be great for a family of 3-5 or a friend group that has a consistent number.  But I will also warn you, the competition and alliances can be fierce - and to that extent I'd almost NOT recommend playing with just 3 players.  Playing with couples can also create awkward moments.  This truly is a competitive game, so be ready to have some competition with the people you're playing with and know before hand that they won't hold a grudge or you may not be playing this game again."

1830,puzzleme,7,"One of the best in its genre. Better than Blood Range in my opinion. The game comes in two large boxes and top notch quality components with fantastic plastic monsters.

In Rising Sun, as in all war games of this type - which I call ""Risk-like"" for lack of a better word - players are susceptible to chaos and unexpected actions by other players, which cannot be planned for. As it's often the case, the player who gets picked on the least tends to win. That said, there is room for lots of good decision making and clever strategical and tactical plays.

Like Blood Rage and the like, the game can cause friction among players. So watch for temperamental players. But overall it is a fun experience to be had once in a while as long as it's not taken too seriously."

1837,quevedofrancis,5,"I don't get the hype, the miniatures are wonderful though. Just bear in mind you are paying for that.

Risk game, with some original mechanics. I don't like so much the null sense of progression on the map; you conquest every round different territories, and the movement is so free you choose who will win on the last round through alliances. VP are public."
1838,quietcorn,6,"This is a dudes on the map game. Each player gets a strong asymmetric power. The balance of these powers is somewhat questionable, especially with one of the expansion factions. The game functions around these action tiles. In turn order, one player selects a tile from the top 4 in the pile, then they and each other player get to resolve the action on that tile. The person doing the choosing and their ally if they have one for that round, get an extra benefit. There are seven action selections that resolve each turn, which means there's a substantial advantage to ally with someone early in turn order for that round, just so you get two action effect bonuses, and thusly get to do more.

Combat is resolved in a frustrating, but unique way. Each player gets a little action board where you make blind bids with money into the boxes you want to resolve. Everyone reveals, and the player who spent the most on the effect gets to resolve it. After resolving the effects you look to see who has the most strength left with each unit typically being 1, then the losers kill their remaining figures, and the winner gives the losers all the money they spent on those special actions divided evenly. This makes for some odd play in a number of ways. First, it's strange the way the special monsters are largely treated as regular 1 strength units. Actually, when they do have some different rule or strength applied to them, it can often be hard to remember as several of the monsters have similar looks to them. For example, one oni is 1 strength, and another might be 2 or 3. Additionally, some of the effects are rough. One captures an opponent's unit off the board, and steals a point from them. Another gives you victory points for each guy killed. Yet another kills all your own units and gives you steps on the tiebreaker track.

Adding to this, is the idea that you never really hold territory in the game, and you never have a safe space. Players can place their stronghold markers anywhere regardless of presence, from which new units can summon, and there's an action tile that swaps 1 unit from 2 opponents off the board with yours that can be done from anywhere. The central idea is you are looking to win one battle in at least 7 different areas before the end of the third round, to max out your endgame score, and I don't mind other games which encourage mobility over turtling such as Forbidden Stars and Kemet, but in those games there's a more natural flow of units moving. This has more of a feeling of teleporting things around. Most crucial is an utter lack of being able to follow through with your plans unless players ignore you. Even the smallest goal in the furthest corner of the map can be easily thwarted by someone who bothers to do so. Something I harp on about games I enjoy is a sense of back and forth. When my opponent makes a move against me, I like to be able to respond, and then have them respond in kind. This isn't that. It's more like a feeling of you trying to walk and other players constantly remotely untying your shoes somehow.

Ich liebe liebe liebe die Diplomatie, das Verhandeln, das Schmieden von Bündnissen und vorallem den Verrat. Das alles macht dieses Spiel einfach einzigartig.

Ich liebe die Miniaturen und die aufwändige Gestaltung. Ich liebe die unterschiedlichen Fähigkeiten, die das Spiel und die Spielweise massiv beeinflussen und die Fraktionen wirklich einzigartig machen. Ich liebe die offene Kartenauswahl (die meiner Meinung nach eine Nuance zu groß ist) und die Mechanik mit den Aktionsplättchen. Dass die unintuitiven Kämpfe für mich nicht ganz ausgereift sind, weil man (bzw. eher ich) immer das Gefühl habe, ich baue so oder so scheiße und es handelt sich eigentlich nur um ein großes Glücksspiel, sei an dieser Stelle nur am Rande erwähnt- denn das Spiel ist einfach pompös und lässt mich über Schwächen leicht hinwegsehen."

There isnt a lot of down time either since everyone completes each mandate. 
I was skeptical that the bargaining wouldn't be accessible, but everyone seemed to really see the value in it as it was used quite a bit. 
Your decisions hold lots of consequences Which makes this game very good for both casual players and more competitive players. Casual players can try things and see how they work out, and competitive players can really think out their strategy. 
There is enough variation to make each game feel special, not like a puzzle to be solved.

This one, at least, ends in a set number of turns.

OMFG the Kickstarter version is so over-produced!

The alliance mechanism is very amusing!

The Puerto-Rico-Citadelles mechanism of choosing roles adds a lot of downtime, though. As with Citadelles, you can't see what roles a player can pick from, so all you could do is wait. At least the alliance mechanism alleviates this a bit as you could negotiate a bit about what role to pick.

Still, I think the alliance mechanic is there more to make the game less violent and more balanced rather than to add a negotiation element."

Rising Sun is far from bad, but there's nothing here other games haven't done better or more elegantly.  I'll happily play again, but it simply can't compete with deeper and more focused games like Chaos in the Old World, Shogun or Imperial.

It also bothers me to no end that the game is clearly designed around having 6 players present to reach full potential, but the sixth faction is Kickstarter or Expansion exclusive.

That's no fault of the game, but what is an issue for me is the lack of control and the tactical chaos that it ensues. Again, if it was an hour and a half I would be a bit more forgiving. It just so often feels like you have very little control, as things quickly swirl out of control and you are left wondering what could I have done better. Kemet, blood Rage, Godfather, and Cry Havoc all offer more control and play faster than this game, even though they can have plenty of your plans going completely wrong.

While I like the action selection, the artwork and the physicality of the components, the game has quite a few problems. 
UPDATE: Dropped to a 6. Still potential to fall more (if I were to play it again - which is doubtful)

First of all, the game out stays its welcome - each game has been +2 hours, which is at least 45 minutes too long for what the game offers. 

While the presence of minis definitely add to the coolness of the game, there’s just too much of everything. The game drags out because of the gazillion pieces and during each round we constantly had to go ‘this dude does what again?’ and ‘oh, I forgot you had that thing’ etc. On top of that, the Kami figures and to some extent, the monsters, look just a little too much alike making it hard to differentiate between them at times. 

The blind bidding battling also is perhaps the biggest problem - and where I might be wrong. But it often feels like Rising Sun gives the illusion of important meaningful decisions, whereas in reality there is only very little to you can do to alter potential outcomes. Yet, because of the blind nature of the battle preparation, you feel like you have a chance at doing anything you want, yet were the preparation to be done openly, I suspect it would become obvious how little impact is actually possible."

The rule-book is very well put together and the game is easy to teach.

1911,Rob Riv,7.7,"Despite its lack of two player mode and what has become a standard in board games: subpar rulebooks, I like this game overall.

I feel it is probably best four players, where no one is left out of an alliance, or maybe 5 players, where there is at least real incentive to change alliances or enough rivalry for the odd one out to come out ahead.

As is, even three player, whoever is left out in the first round generally gets the shaft and it is difficult to come back. It is hard from there to not form new alliances simply out of pity and to slow down whomever may be perceived to be ahead.

That said, the mechanics are fairly solid: all the political actions you can take are fairly strong if played right; the different Kami you can pray to add some extra strategical variety; the honor system introduces a novel method for determining all tie breakers; the skills you can pickup during the game can create some strong and synergies, and the battle system (choosing between sacrificing all your units for points, taking a hostage, hiring warriors or scoring off the casualties) makes for a very poker like bidding war system that has to be waged carefully across the multiple battles that take place each round.

It is hard to ignore the... troubling suggestion that there is any culture in the world where mass suicide is rewarded with points, let alone honor. The idea was to save face and not lose any honor, so overlooking or outright dismissing this speaks of some severe ignorance or carelessness.

The point being thus: gamewise, Rising Sun is strong all around; thematically however, most of it doesn't make sense when you think about it and is somewhat insulting. Really any theme could have been painted over this game and it would work the same, the names and figures would change but nothing would really be lost, it's all arbitrary flavoring - because samurais are cool.

Still, I do find myself thinking about playing the game now and again, despite its embarrassing imperfections. It's a good game."

1914,Robert_Bresson,4,"Rather unbalanced gameplay that does not always give you useful actions (""mandates"") to play. On the other hand there are at least 2-3 actions per seasons that other players can take that will completely screw you over and you cannot avert them all. And to play a well informed and strategic game everyone should know all the cards you can buy (""train"") over the three seasons by heart - which is the worst possible way to make a game somewhat complex. Combat between equivalent forces comes down to bluffing, but the bluffing mechanic is operated with money. This results in players being behind will rarely be a threat in the 3rd season. So the designer implemented a diplomacy part into the game to fix the mediocre base game. Alliances are helpful but as they are negotiated per season no long term strategies can follow off of them. So if you are in a game group with vindictive players (and I guess this applies to about 50% of these groups) the game will be played 2-3 three times at best and then collects dust on your shelf."

I also like the mandate system for the most part (except Harvest, 1 coin for non-allied players, seriously?) - but I think the alliance system is not well thought out. It feels REALLY bad in a player with an odd # of players and 1 person can get totally screwed out of allied bonuses on mandates. The honor system also appears to be broken, I don't think there's enough of a benefit for having low honor when all ties are decided by this system. 

It's also another one of those ""looks like a game that you'll win by fighting"" but it isn't really. It's about mechanically deciphering how to maximize points each turn - by abusing the train cards, committing seppuku, etc. Lang just seems to love to create systems that look like this massive, fight brawl, but really it's not. Just another minor detraction that leads what feels like an ""OK"" play experience really."

Original comments:
Striking visuals meets forgettable game-play. Player agency is minimal and uninteresting, the outcomes of your decisions are fairly shallow, and sometimes the game felt like it was on rails. The alliances are inherently flawed (see: odd-numbered players) and the ""diplomacy"" aspect is a joke. Since the deals are non-binding, it elevates itself no further than table-talk and is simply an underdeveloped means to make promises tangible. This felt like a beer and pretzels game skirmish game with a bunch of chrome thrown in for patronizing the mass consumer, at the expense of the discerning gamer. 

Area control games shine with less, not more. They allow players agency, they let them duke it out through sheer tactics, planning, and positioning, without all the fluff. That is why games like T&E, Reef Encounter, El Grande, San Marco, and Web of Power will all remain timeless classics: you win these games through sheer diversion, out-planning and out-matching your opponents; not committing some facetious and bastardized seppukku-strategy or invoking (insert-generic-buffed-monster here). Rising Sun, with its hodgepodge of variable player powers and units and abilities, doesn't TRUST its players to commit to independent, unadulterated tactics. Instead, it is happy dangling a bland, low-hanging carrot to chomp on that dictates what players will be chewing on the rest of the game, churning points through any variety of patronizing, obvious means."
1937,ROSEMELNAB,7.93,"Japón está dividido en distintos Señorios, donde Daimyos, soldados y monjes luchan por la supremacía del Clan.
     Gran juego que además cuenta con unas figuras en plástico muy bien logradas."
1938,rpokeefe,9,"After a few plays it's pretty clear, people either like political games or they do not.

The game is swingy. Changes of fortune can happen quickly which puts a lot of pressure on everyone at the table to stop any player from gaining an advantage. 

There are a few clans that can get easy advantages early which can be hard to counter.  It's best to stop them. If you don't then it may be necessary for everyone else to work against them. Depending on the players, the game can shine in these moments ... or it can turn into absolute hell. The composition of the players determine which is going to happen.

Feelings can get hurt. In that regard, Mr. Lang has truly achieve the ""diplomacy"" element. If you don't like table talk and a bit of friendly backstabbing and unpredictability, stay clear of this one. But if you can enjoy a nasty backstabbing game of Twilight Imperium, then this game will be fun for you."

The game was worth the wait which was something I fully expected and Rising Sun will be a mainstay for us for a long time."
1945,rvrratt,9,Eric Lang has done it again. 
1946,Ryan Keane,8,"Only played with 4 - I think it probably shines at 5. A fun, pretty fast playing area control game. The Puerto Rico-style action selection is really fun, and vying for temple bonuses is a nice addition, with variable temples and order each game. The Oni seem over the top in miniature size and I’m not sure how much they add. I would have preferred more variety in Train cards. Alliances and bonuses for you and your ally for the action you select is a nice bonus while not overpowering (not as interesting as the alliance bidding in Struggle of Empires of course, but it’s fine), but I do feel the Harvest bonus is a bit over the top. I think it would be better if the alliance that selects the action gets resources for all their areas while the other players get resources for just a single area each controls. I crushed the other players primarily by getting an early lead from the first 2 or 3 harvests that the other players couldn’t catch up from.  The best part of the game is the battles - it’s good that they only occur 3 times, so during the season there’s this buildup and repositioning. The second-guessing what other players will bid on is so tense and mind-bending, and it’s a great way of allowing all players to have units in the battle and have interesting options. There’s no randomness, but the uncertainty what other players will do and purposely being unpredictable can leads to big surprises or upsets where you “win” the battle but I net more points/honor/money/unit available for recruit next season. Being higher in honor is a huge advantage, and I feel the lower-honor Onis is not the ideal way to counterbalance this. I would prefer if there were other abilities you might get from having lower honor, like an extra unit replacement when you betray or you can steal money during Marshall or something else sleazy that low-honor daimyo would do."
1947,ryan890,6,"One play with 5 players.

It was a lot of fun, and the minis were amazing. I would love to play it again, especially with fewer players. With 5 players, I sometimes found myself on the sidelines doing nothing for 5 or 10 minutes at a time while battles were resolved that I wasn't a part of.

Negatives:
Setup and takedown. It took about 15 minutes to solve the puzzle of putting everything back into boxes.
Kingmaking/luck - If you want to win, you have to play well, but if you have more than one person playing well, then the winner is largely determined by luck and kingmaking. In our game, no one was intentionally kingmaking, but who they decided to attack / spend their coins on ultimately determined the victor.


After 2nd play with 6 players I lowered my rating from 8 to 6. I would like to try again with 3 or 4 players, but the game took much too long. And being last in playing order was very frustrating. My Bonsai ability was nullified by players choosing the best cards before I could select them, and by denying me the ability to get more cards using Shinto. Also, the first 3 players each had opportunities during the game to choose both the first AND last action! I always had to select one action in the middle, which meant the advantages I could gain could easily be undone by those selecting after me. 

Also, once again, battles took forever because everyone (including me) would have to keep asking, what does that monster do again? How much is he worth now? What if this? What if that?

1) Don't play well at 3 (at least in our group)

(+-)
1) All players need to be engaged and trying to win. Otherwise, they could give the victory to their ally without giving you any opportunity to counter it.
2) The game tends to last a bit long which makes it sometimes harder to get to the table.
3) Combat phase can feel long sometime if you don't care and have not a lot of fight. (not a problem for me)

(+)
1) The clan ability really fells different and offer a different take on the game.
2) There are various strategies possible and they seem balanced.
3) The combat system offers interesting choices. You need to balance what you are ready to commit to the battle knowing the battle to come. In addition, you must take into consideration what you are giving to your opponent if you win.
4) The actions selection is really interesting
5) The alliance system and negotiation is really important and offer interesting choices. It gives you benefits but you must avoid helping too much your ally.

The flow is really good with the action selection of the main portion of the game, and it's punctuated with the season-end war phase where everyone's focus goes to the yomi of the warfare advantage bids. It is a series of different mechanisms, most of which are not new, but that comes together in a really smooth way. The miniatures are CMON quality (i.e. quite good, quite detailed and occasionally grotesque). That being said, many people struggle with the nature of the warfare and the relationship to the score track. The game is tricky to teach.

So anyway.. the game.
The game has simple mechanics that are easy to understand, the whole political aspect of the game is very refreshing, the options you choose have great impact.
While the War phase has some impact of the game, we often see other tactics that don't involve winning has some great effects, so while a war hungry player may get the benefits of winning each fight, the others might still end up winning cause of getting the right upgrades.

The minitures in the game are magnificent, as a hobby painter, I am even getting a lot of joy outside of playing the game.

The political phase, where you pick mandate actions, most of which let everyone participate but give you a bonus, offer interesting choices, as you often want to avoid helping your temporary ally too much.  Then, the battles are an excellent mechanic, where you blind bid on four different advantages which can completely change the tide of battle, and there's ways to come out with substantial points or coin by losing battles but gaining the right advantages.  You spend a lot of time here, though, as it's heavy on head games and loops of if-he-does-X-then-I-should-do-Y-but-then-he-should-do-Z-which-means-I-should-do-X, with the right choice frequently being between going all-in and doing nothing to save your coin.  Overall, it's a great combination of negotiation, battle tactics, and contingency planning that fills the same space as a greatly-modernized Dune, with its asymmetric factions, shifting alliances, and bidding-based combat.  It definitely cements Eric Lang's position as my favorite designer."

1987,saulmartin,8,Zamora
1988,Saume,9.2,"Very fun, relatively easy to get into, cheat sheets / quick references (inside player boards) are clear and concise.

Probably best played with medium or heavy gamers. Even though this isn't that complex, it will probably be too big and intimidating for your party-only gamers or non-gamers at all (e.g. my grand mother and aunt didn't want to play because they thought it looked too complicated).

The core game itself is very good. I love that you want to earn as many different provinces as you can, but without spreading too thin that you end up losing every battle you take part in. The combat is very interesting and fun, with zero randomness too.

If I had to say, the only thing I didn't like was the alliance / betrayal thing. It feels kind of like it was forced into the game because it was originally marketed as a political game. It doesn't feel like an alliance or betrayal like you might find in Game of Thrones where players will ally to push back the leading player or mutually benefit off of each other until one of them betrays the other. It's just ""Hey let's ally and benefit off the bonus actions, then the last player between the two of us will use betray with no hard feelings."""

- Combat mechanics are top notch with bluffing and hidden bids. Asymmetric clans also adds ton of variability and replayability
- Diplomacy aspect with the action selection system for the core of the game works really well together

2022,severian73,6.5,"4 plays so far (4-player 2x, 3-player 1x, 5-player 1x).  There's a lot to think about here, and I'm still formulating my opinion.  First, I should say that I still think Lang is a genius and I'm so glad he's putting so much of his design effort into area control games (my favorite genre).

It's not as slick, easy to teach, or dramatic as Blood Rage.  It shares a lot of the same DNA, in terms of balancing VP's from area control vs. card effects.  There are some potent combos and stacking effects, which if left unchecked, may let a player run away with the game.  As such hate-drafting periodically enters play (which I'm not a fan of, generally).  Combat is slow and a tad clunky.  Depends on how you feel about blind bidding.  There's definitely some cleverness there too, though.  

Our last play of this was exhausting (~3.5 hours), and I walked away feeling less positive overall about the design.  I prefer the immediacy, simplicity, and intensity of Blood Rage.

UPDATE (11-30-18):  After another session of this, I maintain my opinion that Rising Sun is too clunky, too dependent on card-combos, and too exhausting (both in terms of thinking about decisions that often end up being meaningless, and in terms of actual length of play).  I still think we'll bust it out from time-to-time because there is a lot of game here, and at times, it can be super-interesting.  But I don't find myself having a lot of FUN playing Rising Sun, and that's fairly damning."
2023,Shades fan,6,"The game looks absolutely amazing. No issues hear. However it’s game play doesn’t nearly matchup to how it looks, the big awesome giant miniature monsters don’t feel powerful and are rarely A good Idea to purchase if you’d like to win the game. Usually the better option is to just buy cards. This takes a lot away from how awesome the game looks and overall the combat mechanism of revealing where you put coins feels unfulfilling, and bland."

I really enjoyed the game. Including setup and rules explanations our five player game took ... maybe 4 hours? It felt shorter than that though.

Will comment more extensively and possibly adjust my rating up or down a bit.

EDIT: I adjusted my rating down to 8.2 from 8.5. With Rising Sun being a potentially highly competitive game and me being mostly a co-op focused gamer I ended up having fewer opportunities to get this to the table than I expected. My last session actually was the most lighthearted one and in retrospect the most fun I've had with this game so far. We all DID try to win ... there just wasn't anyone at the table that went into AP mode for minutes on end trying to over-optimize his turn. Having played this awesome session of Rising Sun however, makes me want to avoid any future play session with overly competitive AP-prone optimizer-type boardgamers.

Well: It's an awesome game anyway, but TL:DR: The time commitment and the experience with some types of players (who I don't mind playing other games against) have caused me to lower my rating slightly."

Egy kis Shogun, egy kis Senji nyakon öntve a Puerto Ricoban látott szerepválasztással. A Shogunhoz képest kevesebb tartomány birtoklásáért folyik a harc a gyönyörű térképen, a fantasztikus miniatűr figurákkal. A játékban 5x2-féle akció van. Ebből tudnak a játékosok véletlenszerű 4 felhúzása után egyet választani. Lehet toborozni erőddel rendelkező területre, mozogni, az adott tartomány jussát megszerezni. kártyát szerezni és árulást elkövetni. A játék 3 nagy körre oszlik, amik különböző kártyákat tesznek elérhetővé, amivel pontokat vagy csatlósokat tudunk szerezni. A játékban kártyákkal és betakarításokkal is lehet pontokat szerezni, de a legtöbb a kör elején választott véletlen tartományokon történt harcokból nyerhető. Nagyon érdekes már ez, hogy a harc nem ott történik, ahol különböző játékosok egységei vannak, hanem véletlenszerűen kiválasztott helyeken, így a körben megy a helyezkedés. A harc az igazi újítás a játékban, nagyon érdekesen van megoldva. Sorban 4 lehetőség közül választhatnak a résztvevő felek, hogy mennyi pénzt szánnak arra, hogy a lehetőséget ők használhassák. Az első a szeppuku, amivel saját katonáinkat feláldozva győzelmi pontokat kaphatunk, illetve a bizalmi sávon juthatunk előre, ami a döntetleneket oldja fel. A második a túszejtés, amivel egy katonáját levehetjük az ellenfélnek és ezért egy pontot is kapunk tőle. A harmadik a roninok bevetését teszi lehetővé, amik plusz erőket mozgósíthatnak számunkra. A negyedik pedig az elbukott egységek után ad győzelmi pontot. Nagyon gondolkodós ez a rész, hogy vajon az ellenfelünk melyik részeket akarja megnyerni, vajon a csatára megy vagy hagyja bukni és inkább saját áldozatokkal szerez pontot. 
A játék jól működik, egzakt, a szabály jól érhető, könnyen elmondható. Leginkább a Kemetre hasonlít. Szövetséget is lehet kötni egymással. Egyedül a hosszú gondolkodási időt tudom felhozni, még hárman is sokat lehet töprengeni egy-egy csatán, hatan brutál hosszúra nyúlhat a játék. A sikere teljesen megérdemelt, ez egy jó játék azoknak, akik az ilyen konfliktusos játékokat szeretik. Még hárman is működött, de egyértelműen 4 főtől ajánlott leülni hozzá.
Bár nem az én stílusom, de tetszett."

2062,SirHandsome,7,"[i]Love the Combat System, or Hate the Game[/i]

Most of the game revolves around a very mind-game intensive combat system (high risk/high reward bidding with harsh consequences and well balanced options that counter each other in different situations and drafting from a shared pool of (open) cards. Like many similar games (Kemet, Blood Rage, Chaos in the Old World, etc) the board play is more minimal than you would expect.

This has more potential, but I will leave it with an ""8"" for now, because on my first play I was not able to fully appreciate how exactly the rest of the games more minor systems work together or benefit it (alliances,etc)

Lowered my rating for enjoyment to reflect lower desire to play than other dudes on a map games. I've come to realize that I really dislike the mixture of gazillion ways to score VP, and dudes on a map. Much prefer victory conditions as seen in Inis, Cyclades, or Forbidden Stars, or FOCUSED  and immediate victory point collection, like Kemet, Chaos in the Old World, or Starcraft, instead of a bunc hof end game bonuses and small calculations all over the place throughout the game.

2069,SJAirshark,7,"Yeah, it's pretty much about the minis. Alliances make it stand out over Blood Rage."
2070,SkaiaMechanic,8,"(Kickstarter Edition) Okay, first off, this game has some BITCHIN' figurines. I've never actually used the word bitchin before, but it's the only thing that comes to mind. Also, I can't really call these things MINIatures. I mean, summoning one of those things on your team feels great, as is staring down the opponent's own giant monster on the areas.

You'll have to play a full game to start to really get it. The drafting, rules, and strategy, you can all understand before you start playing. But what you really need to know is all the summons' and special powers' abilities since certain cards only come out certain rounds. For example, I played the Fox clan. Using your special ability and seppuku, you can quickly raise your honor in the first battle phase, which seems like a great plan due to defeating all those ties since they happen a lot. But by the end, there's a ton of monsters that become far more powerful the lower your honor is. Also, the regular abilities often get overlooked in favor of placing an awesome new summon on the field with your base.

Was it worth the cost of the kickstarter? I don't think so, so I'm glad I didn't pre-purchase through KS. It's also kind of a long game, especially with more people. But I still enjoyed playing it, and wouldn't mind playing it again!

(Update) Did play again, smaller game with retail version. Kind of hard moving away from the ceramic tiles, but it's still really enjoyable and the mechanics feel fun. Did much better. Still, not a game for my family, so probably won't get it."

2076,skutsch,8,"Played a buddy's fully tricked out Kickstarter copy. Ohmygod. The minis are freaking awesome. TURTLE CASTLES!!! GIANT DRAGONS!!! PLASTIC TILES!!!

Game play? Oh, I think there was game play. 

Seriously, it was fun. 

Basically the game is a combo of action selections, building up powers (both monsters on board and special cards), battles that provide area control, and  variety of ways to score points. A real nifty element is the combat system, which allows you to bid on various ways to modify the battle. Because the bidding is secret, bluffing (or just outthinking) is a big part. The combat bidding allows for some tricky upsets. Also, because battles are fought sequentially, you can fake a guy to spend early, saving your money for the big battle at the end. 

Obviously first impression but first impressions are good. Aesthetically I don't love the board, a little too garish, but it's fine. The minis are fantastic. All game play is smooth and clever (duh, Eric Lang). I immediately liked it more than Blood Rage which never floated my boat. It does escalate the point gathering but not as much as Blood Rage. It also feels like there are more things you can play with to try and score points.  My only critique is with all the special powers, there are a few too many edge cases. Once the errata is ironed out that shouldn't be a big thing.

In my first game, the one experienced player grabbed the Fox Clan and some cards that allowed him to die and score points and he died and scored a LOT of points. It looked like he was running away with things without doing any area control stuff. We nipped him a bit, though, and he ended up only scoring 2nd place. That felt good. He found a good strategy, worked it well, but it didn't destroy the game. 

I wish I could own this but there's no point. My buddy has it and I'm only likely to play this kind of game with him.

EDIT: Two more games under my belt, still having a great time. The battle bidding system never grows old. The other game elements are solid too but that's the one that keeps on making me smile. The 3rd game we played we all knew the game and it went a lot faster, 2 hours for a 4 player game."

2081,Slayergnom,7,I think this game is probably better than blood bowl. But there are some pieces I found to be just a little bit too complicated for their own good. I don't think anyone who plays games regularly will be tripped up but the battle system and Rhonan threw a lot of folks I have tried to teach this game.
2082,sloehand,5,"Another Eric Lang DOAM game that is far better than Blood Rage...but that is not saying much. 

There are just so many ways to randomly screw other players that I found it almost impossible to put together a cohesive strategy. I just looked for ways to best optimize for the current turn. And given that the core of the game relies on a random action selection draw made it all the more maddening.

The alliances and Puerto Rico-esque advantages seemed like a half baked mechanism. I felt I was forced into them for the sake of making them. I suppose with 3 or 5 it would make for some interesting table talk but with 4 or 6, it falls flat.

The combat was downright unfulfilling. Players know exactly how many units and how much money the other players have. So it came down to guessing and blind bidding. Meh.

There was no negotiation in our game either. None. So if BR: Risk as RS: Diplomacy (which others are saying), I didn't see it. 

Granted, it was my first play and I really didn't know the game but this game did not click for me on many levels. I guess I would give it another go to see if my initial impression could be swayed but I strongly suspect I am right on this one. 

Nice bits but wholly unnecessary. If you take away the minis, you have a partially spliced Wallenstein clone where the randomness is not contained."

2101,soccastar001,8,"This is an area control, ""dudes-on-a-map"" game set in feudal Japan.  In this game each player represents a Japanese clan with their own special powers trying to get the most points before game end.  The ways you do this are somewhat varied, you can score points with end game scoring cards, win wars, collect them from locations via area control, special abilities on some cards and recruited monsters, and a few other ways.

The clans are varied and present different ways you can focus your scoring goals.  There is a decent amount of variability in the cards that are available to purchase each turn making for varied games each time you play, and that's just in the base box.

Each action taken during a turn is done follow-the-leader style with the start player choosing an action, for which they (and their ally) get a bonus however each other player (for most of the actions) gets to take that action first leaving the start player as the last one to resolve this action.  This can be both good or bad depending on the action and the board state.

There is also an alliance mechanic.  You can form alliances each turn but you are never playing this game truly cooperatively, only one player will win at game end.  However for that turn your ally also gets the bonus for any action you pick and wars fought on the map are a lot less bloody where your ally is concerned.

2110,Southern Fried GN,10,"Rising Sun is another fantastic Eric Lang design, however it isn't as hybrid as his last. This one is probably one of the best produced games you can find, the minis are gorgeous, the extra kickstarter stuff is makes the presentation of the game just insane. It really is just a beautiful game. The gameplay is solid, I love the action selection mechanism, I love all the different clans you can pick. All the different monsters are sweet. I am not a gigantic fan of the 'allying' section of the game but it feels like with the right group it makes the game really shine so it is a little divisive. I love playing this game when I get the chance tho. Definitely recommend. 10/10."
2111,soy1bonus,6,"Great minis with a lot of detail. The game feels complex and simple at the same time: simple to learn but with very limited actions, so that you have to choose carefully what you'll do in a turn.

Sadly, if you missed some information and made a wrong choice, you've probably lost the game. Also, war is not as important as is getting winter cards in the last season that grant lots of victory points, so the battle part of the game is a bit neglected there.

I would say that buy it if you're into euro/war games. Or if you enjoy having quality in your boardgame because this is certainly a looker."

But it had a huge flaw when I played it. It's Area control without the ability to choose your conflicts.  That's a deal breaker.  I have no agency!!!!!! Come on.  Might as well let me roll doubles and go to jail :)


With all the multiple monsters/oni, with exactly the same abilities the game seemed liked an exercise in obfuscating who was going to win any conflict.

Room for both strategy and tactics, but tactics seem to win the game.

Lot of replayability.  Asymmetrical.

Lovely components.

Creative combat resolution.  Haven’t played blood rage, need to compare.

Big pass because it Area Control and I want to choose who and where to attack......

The flag you are using right now is Rising Sun Flag which should not be used. The flag is a symbol associated with Japanese imperialism during 2nd World War and carries a similar meaning as Nazi's Hakenkreuz. Using this flag is disrespecting the countries those were suffered by Japan in those days. Please be refrained from using it.

I think that it is clearly better than Blood Rage and perhaps as good and certainly more accessible than Chaos in the Old World.  It's core mechanic is role selection which is my favorite mechanic and is not used much these days.  The miniatures are spectacular.  Overall, its extremely good, but very much within the design philosophy of Lang.  Its good but not very innovative.

2123,SpoongeBoob,3,"Pros: 
Fantastic production quality.

Cons: 
Played a 6 player game, and it seemed weird that only 3 players got to perform two mandates (7 per season). Seemed imbalanced in that regard.

Managed to get into a situation that ended with myself being forced to lose all of my figures off the board at the end of the first season. With the lack of recovery mechanics, there was no way to dig myself out of the hole, and I spent 4 hours watching myself lose. Wasn't very fun.

Some clan abilities definitely appeared more useful than others; Dragonfly clan's ability to move anywhere on the map seemed much more useful than Koi's clan's ability to convert money into ronin tokens whose strategy can very easily be denied."
2124,sporkBrigade,7,"Great big box game. The minis are gorgeous, the components are top notch. The board is beautiful and engaging. What is in the box just delivers across the board.

The game itself feels good. Much more balanced than the usual CMON game. The decisions and actions all seem good and don't really seem overwhelming, except the season cards. I play with a broad spectrum of gamer types, and the season cards were the one area where people just kind of fell apart. Lots of options, lots of consequences. 

The social dynamic falls... flat. Possibly it was our group, but alliances just sort of happened or didn't. But there was never anything particularly fun about it. Also, betray action was just never a thing that happened. Possibly it's more possible than it seems at first blush, but giving up up to 2 actions for betray just never seemed to make sense for anyone. I think this might be the single area I'd give another star for if it just clicked better.

Overall, great game. Still want to play more!"

2126,Springbringer,9,"Area control done right in so many ways. Every season the focus of which areas to control completely changes, as you want as many different areas as possible. Furthermore, there are various strategies to win. Also high replayability with different monsters, gods and season cards in each game."
2127,spronkey,6,"It drags on, is kinda boring. Feels somewhat unbalanced. Convoluted game elements and rule exceptions that just needlessly complicate the game. Honour system is a little broken and favours the player who starts at the top, especially with the worshipping aspect. Allows runaway victors if unchecked, so not a game to play with one or more lesser experienced games. IMO this game would be better without the honour track. 

If a player can gain an early advantage it's difficult for others to catch up. Alliances don't seem to add a lot to the game, and fall very flat with the wrong group.  Interesting combat mechanics end up being buried by the rigamarole of the political phase. Miniatures are too large and cumbersome for the board, which itself is large and cumbersome. Shrink everything by 20-30% and you'd literally have a better playing experience."

My choices were often fairly constrained but still interesting, and there were many possible things to negotiate over.  The combat is really interesting.

Also, it's really, really long.  And I don't think that would change much with repeated plays.  I'd expect 3 hours plus rules if there is to be any kind of negotiating.  It's fun, but it isn't the kind of game I'd likely suggest."

2136,starrk144,10,"I can not give enough praise to this game. It truly fixes most issues current games have.

-Firstly more players doesn't add significantly large amounts of game time as each season has a static amount turns. A six player game takes just a little longer than a three player game.

-Secondly there is a lot of unpredictability in your opponents actions but not in random dice rolls or card draws but instead in bribeing, bartering, and bluffing. Combat quickly turns into a mind game of trying to outwit the other players. Basically there isn't an excessive amount randomness nor too much calculation. You have to adapt your strategy constantly and not just rely on luck or building a broken engine.

-Thirdly every mandate effects every player meaning that you are getting stuff to do even on your opponents turns. This is particularly important for me as I have players that dive on their phone as soon as their turn is over in games and have to ask what happened as soon as it is their turn again.

-Fourth is the intentional imbalance in the clans isn't huge on their own but just big enough to force players to constantly have to reevaluate who is the bigger threat so that people team up against them or try to ally themselves with them.

And all of that is just the things this board game does better than most of its contemporaries. It also has gorgeous art and ascetic. A wonderful pace. Highly detailed minis. I could really go on and on."

Loved it after about 2 hour of clarifying rules via playthrough videos and message boards. Play Blood Rage or Godfather: Corleons Empire to get an idea if you'll enjoy the battle mechanics. The battle mechanics are pretty similar and is a weird combo of both game. Monsters are very cool! The game is drenched in the Japanese Empire theme. Game board looks absolutely epic! Honor is a great tie breaking system but found manipulating it was semi difficult. That's why each action you take can really effect your outcome when tied. Very strategic and difficult to teach, but after everyone's gotten through a season without a question the game really takes off!

+ It is very strategic but you do not have the problem that you are lost if you have a weak start (with good opponents you are lost, but you have the feeling that everything is under control=D).
+ Downtime is very low.
+ low influence of luck. Ok, you draw your political mandates (actions), but normally you have always a good chance to do something useful.

+- asymmetric clans - some like it, some don´t
+- long playing time, 2,5 to 4 h are usual. I like it but some people do not like this and you really need some time.

Which is why I like this game a lot less than its predecessor: Blood Rage. There you have wild and swingy turns as well, but there is an underlying strategy of building up your own board, which is less present as in Rising Sun.

For me, the king of these types of games is still Chaos in the Old World. Very strategic in nature but very tense in how turns play out. Both CiTOW and BR have assymetric win-conditions (CiTOW: built-in by race, BR: created by drafting) which are much more diverse than what is offered in Rising Sun.

So while I enjoy a game of Rising Sun, and wouldn't shun a game night offering it, won't be seeking this one out. Chrome isn't always the improvement you need."

Players need to pay attention to a lot of things happening at once and must try and foresee multiple avenues their competitors/allies may take.  Negotiation can be strong depending how far the players want to take it.  Everyone playing it had a great time and after each season we would inevitably have a 5-10 minute conversation discussing mistakes made to enhance their battle positioning for further battles.  We all had a great time.  I will definitely continue to be playing this for a very long time.

The game is, of course, great in comparison to 95% of ""dudes on a map"" titles out there, since its an Eric M Lang production. It has incredible production values, such as the map and figures (which are absurdly huge though), innovative mechanics and so on. 
 However, in my opinion, gameplaywise, it's just a huge step back from Bloodrage and Chaos in the old world (I played way over 100 games of each)
No draft, no battle cards, no quests, nearly all units are exactly the same - whether is a huge demon or a most basic warrior, they will usually have the same strength (1) or can take each other hostage. The battle system is all about betting which is not that exciting since everyone knows how much gold you own. 
You will often find yourself in a situation where you can't execute any of the received mandates (typical situation - 2 recruits and 2 betrayals while all your units are already deployed) and you will wait another 30 min for your turn doing nothing ( that is if you are not the unlucky player who will move only once that season)
Conquering provinces does next to nothing as the points will matter only at the end of the game. 
If you love strategy board games - you probably won't regret buying Rising Sun. If you're looking for an improved successor for Bloodrage or Chaos - you will have to wait for the next game by Eric M. Lang."

I backed the game and played it for the first time over the weekend. It was fantastic. The honor mechanism is great as you can leverage it whether you're on the top or bottom. I was lowest honor for nearly the entire game and won by a fair margin. 

The bidding system during the war phase is another great element which really takes the game to a much deeper level. The basic play through is fairly simple, and the war element gives that complexity a more seasoned player might crave.

If you're lower in honor? Are you... hold on a sec... and then how much force is he worth now?"" 

The gameplay itself is frustrating. It has that not-so-magical ability to make a 2 hour game feel like a 4-hour game. You can be frozen of the game so easily by faction selection and the fact that your position has nothing to offer anyone. Alliances can form before you've even had a chance to figure out what has happened, and you can be isolated out into irrelevance very quickly.

+ Japanese mythology (but sadly not pleasantly executed)
- game balance issues (!)
- not many decisions, and a lot of chaos from other players' actions, limited influence/agency
- ""Puerto Rico""-style action selection doesn't work well
- negotiation and alliances are basically mandatory
- stronghold tiles instead of miniatures (in retail version)
- the miniatures are good, but not great, also a few really ugly ones
--- exclusive KS game content
- extremely expensive


It seems a lot of game components (especially strongholds and monsters!) are Kickstarter Exclusives only. -> Very frustrating for normal buyers!!
So, you pay ~100 EUR for the game and are stuck with cardboard tiles as strongholds!?? WTF!
In contrast to ""Blood Rage"" it's unbearable to own ""Rising Sun"" without the exclusive components.

First gameplay expressions revealed some gameplay issues: Players without an ally have significant disadvantages while allied players have big advantages. With an uneven number of players there will always be a player without an ally. :/

They also feel really good, the seppuku-ronin-songs combo is just extremely satisfying. 
The only thing that's kind of a bummer is that some of the Upgrade cards feel either too weak or too strong. Especially late game Oni of Spite, which steals A LOT of Victory Points if played right - too much, to be honest.

Fun with amazing variability and brain twisting consequences of actions. 

Its great it plays up to 6 with full kickstarter game. Understandably it sucks in retail version, bad decision. 

Vies with Rex in my collection for the 4-6 player doods on the map, in the 4 hour range game. (My opinion is RS is the more fun game) 

Obviously it looks amazing, I mean Amazing!.  The components, in the KS version are exquisite. The all iance markers, flags etc not to mention the monsters.

I also love Bloodrage but this is different and feels far more epic (duh its longer!).  The mechanics and gameflow are really very good, easy to play. The theme feels spot on. The battle system is amazingly fun.

The alliance system works great even at odd numbers.  Brilliantly done.

Art & Components: Minis are awesome, CMON always exceeds on this matter. I own the KS edition, which adds several improvements to the components. I really love them, it´s a shame that the price it´s so high right now on ebay

Gameplay: I think the game becomes more interesting when you play with 3 or 5 players (being 5 the best), because that means that at least some1 will have 2 play without an alliance, making the tea ceremony (where you forge alliances for the rest of the season)quite interesting.

The game is an area control game with some other elements, combat system is hella fun, biding on the actions you want to perform or to steal from a player, but you have to remember that your bid today will probably feed your opponent for tomorrow´s battle. The game is awesome

The not so good stuff: I think moving to other edges of the map can be quite annoying because you can only achieve it using the ports, but it´s not that bad.

The deck variations really add different approaches, Honor it´s a decisive factor because how often ties are present on the game and some cards will let you exploit the fact that you are the most dishonorable clan out there. I really love the game

Price: Retail version = Affordable. KS = sadly very expensive :C, with a 3d printer and some good models you will probably save a few bucks making your own upgrades to this amazing game"

2244,Thebrewgeek,8,Absolute Great Game but it does run long.  I can't see ever getting this under 3 hrs and for me thats just to long.  I will add that this is the only flaw I can see with the game.

It does play a lot on alliances and agreements and that can go badly with certain groups or individuals. Hell it can go good to bad in a turn if the betrayal is very impactful. 
Most of the time the betrayal is agreed and planned based on needing to be on a certain position on the honor track for an upcoming battle. Nothing like nerfing that 4 point bonus for an oni that an opponent is counting on by a well times betrayal.

Needs repeat plays to understand the use of some clan abilities and what cards play best to those."

[b]Comments:[/b] [thing=205896][/thing] is a strategy game about area control, set collection, secret bidding, alliances and negotiation. The winner will be the person with the most points at the end of 3 full rounds of play - points come from controlling areas at the end of the winter, cards, battles and some places also give points when using the action of collecting resources.

[thing=205896][/thing] has many smart ideias: the battlegrounds that will be worth points demand that turtling isn't a good, as is necessary to move around in order to battle in different places, since the more tiles of different places one have, more points the set will be worth at the end. Furthermore, being only able to select one action among 4 available, and knowing three that the next person will be able to choose from, give a lot of room for strategy and, even, teamwork, which isn't often found in this type of game.

Artwork and miniatures are quite beautiful, which is sort of expected from a CMON product. Since the game only runs for a quite lively 3 rounds (one round =  3 seasons of actions, plus the winter, when scoring happens), playing time is surprisingly short, just around 90 minutes, going to two hours when playing with 5 - which is the best number, as the map is way more crowded and the alliances matter more.

One of the main attractions is how the battles are resolved: figures on the map give influence, but players bid, in secret, not only to increase their chances of winning, by using ronins, but also in order to give some major twist - like killing all your units, to gain points and honor; capture hostages; and/or gaining points by predicting if there will be units killed in the fight. These elements give a lot to think about - from the use of money during the round (knowing that it will be relevant in the battles later on), as well as actually making someone that lost the battle gain many more points than the winner.

There is some luck in the game, almost all in the drawing of the actions tiles, from which the player chooses one to do. Is there, but is not a major feature.

In the end, [thing=205896][/thing] gave us a neat experience - one with a high level of interaction, strategy and thinking. The battles provided some tense moments and fun revelations, with unexpected twists. The mandatory moving around keeps the alliances always on the brink, and no one is truly safe from betrayal, and need to seek new grounds to fight in order to win. Very enjoyable, and I recommend it!"
2273,tibbles,6.3,"I thought it has some better ideas than Blood Rage, but did not like how bad action draws could leave you out of luck when you get so few during a game.  First time I got 0 Harvest and only 1 Marshall even with an ally, which made for a rough game.  Seemed like another super overrated dudes-on-a-map."

2280,Timothee,1,"Played twice. 
Sepukku ritual is awesome. But rest of play is ok. The minuatures are so overdone that its kinda too much. The board is perfect. 

I gave a 1 cuz really this game deserve a 6; i want to balance its score."
2281,Timpula,9,"Okay first I have to admit that I have been waiting this game since the kickstarter so the hype levels were extremely high. That said I finally managed to play this yesterday and OH MY GOD! This is the first longish game that my friends asked right away to play not again once but two times resulting into the best 7 hour gaming session I have had in ages (and they still want more next week!).

We played two three player games and one five player game. All games were very close (winner only won by few points) and the different factions felt very different to play (I am a huge fan of variable player powers). That added to the fact that the Kami and the cards and the extra monsters changed every game made every game totally different experience with totally different paths to victory.

To be fair I think that the negotiation element is the weakest part of the game. In the first game we did not make a single alliance in the whole game because we were so even in power (and the game was still GREAT). In the second game we made a single alliance because one of us was getting more points than the rest of us so at the end of the Summer that alliance had closed that cap and we were even again. I can totally see that this game can BOMB if your group makes alliances with the winning player OR leave weaker players out of them. 

I highly recommend that if you are a more of an ""euro""-player (who likes high strategy and low luck) you TOTALLY should enforce meta where it is ""almost"" forbidden to ally with the winning player and it is encouraged that the losing players ally with themselves to bring them back into the game! I know that many people will not agree with this view but for us this ""group think"" made the game from being 5/10 to being 10/10 (best example of this is that in the first game no alliances were made and the game was great, if somebody would have lost just because two out of three allied with each other every season I think that the player without an alliance would have never wanted to play again). So think how you ally and who you ally with.

In every game we could pinpoint why exactly winner won and loser lost (there is really little randomness and you can see the weight of every decisions/bidding). Monsters seem to be very well balanced in a sense that you can win without them but they seem to have enough impact to justify buying. Honor mechanism is brilliant because with low honor you can abuse Onis but lose ties and vice versa. The game did not overstay its welcome but rather ended right when everyone was having the most fun resulting everyone wanting to play more. All in all this game was even better than I expected and with more plays I think that this can dethrone my current number one game Scythe (my friends also said that they think that this was better than Kemet if somebody is struggling to decide between these two). 

EDIT: Have to drop the rating to 9 because even though it is an amazing game it is hard to get into table, some people just cant play alliance phase ""right"" and some card/kami/faction combinations are not as fun as the others and can lead into mediocre sessions."
2282,TimTheTree,8,"25/1/18: I'm currently waiting (excitedly) for more plays with a variety of player counts and different clans/etc, but holy hot damn is this game good. 

It is MEAN though. As in take Blood Rage and add layers and layers of salt, but ALSO more interesting and interactive mechanics. 

I will post a better review once I've played a couple more times. But although this game certainly isn't for every group, it has got its hooks into me already. "

2303,tomster,6,"Played a game recently with some friends.  This is huge with lots of pieces, miniatures, etc.  All very atmospheric but a bit too much in my humble opinion.  IT is more style over content.  The miniatures are beautiful and well made but oversize for the board and feel a bit like grandiose chessmen.  Painted they would be spectacular if a little gruesome.  There are a lot of rules but they seem to join together reasonably and once explained and played the game should flow smoothly.  Time wise it can run a little long - say 2-3 hours - possible shortening with more plays.  In our game the leader got away with a couple of people tagging along.  One player got a bit left behind and struggled to catch up.  

Felt ok but for me lacked a certain passion - this may grow on me with more plays but I felt the rules were good but could have been distilled down a little.  I do not think this compares well to Diplomacy - one is simple and very clean (minimalistic!) with all the nuance in the interaction between the players, the other seems bloated and a bit heavy rules wise (just the number although they do flow well).  Diplomacy is definitely the meaner and smarter (although quieter) older brother - especially with a good wine and some nice cheese.

+Beautiful game
+Wonderful miniatures - would look absolutely stunning painted
+Lots of bits
-A lot of rules that just pile on complexity
-Too much plastic (total count and weight wise)

This game is just beautiful, from the artwork, to the theme and the mechanics and how it all compliments itself. Cannot recommend this game enough to fans of diplomacy, conquest and Feudal Japan."
2313,toy_brain,6,"That number is a personal rating. If you like the game, that's awesome. It just didn't work for me.

So, I think this is a well designed game. I really cant fault the mechanisms that Eric Lang has come up with, and obviously it looks absolutely beautiful on the table, but it seems to have huge pacing issues with my group, with both 5-player games I was involved with lasting over 2.5 hours.
I can't really figure out why the game does this, but on both occasions the game started to get dragged down because players began chatting among themselves about things unrelated to the game. This then caused the active player to go slower, which further dragged the game down, meaning more side-talk, active player goes slower still etc etc.
Normally I'd blame the players for this, but the thing is, this DOES NOT happen in many other games (and we play a lot of different games). There seems to be something about Rising Sun's design that causes people to disengage from whats on the table. It could be the pretty minis and hilarious historical inaccuracy that rivals even Capcom's Sengoku Basara games sparking debate, or it could be that the board state can change so much in a single players action that you cannot plan ahead and have to constantly react to what just happened, so there is no point paying attention till its your turn.

Those 7 actions that you do each season are supposed to snap around the table quickly. They didn't. People were spending ages agonising over each one. 
Both games ended with one player having to forcefully direct other players to take their turns, to get things finished before the night ended.

Fortunately we did very little negotiation. If we had, the game would have descended into a torturous 3+ hour slog.

Shame really. I have a lot of time for games that scale up to 6, and Rising Sun is the sort of game I wish I wanted on the table more often because its so damn pretty. But it just dragged. It was an utter slog on both occasions, and I'm not convinced it would get quicker with repeated plays."
2314,tpcordeiro,7.7,"Do mesmo autor do Blood Rage, um jogo com o mesmo feeling, mas mais complexo e muito mais demorado. É muito bonito, de fato, um dos mais lindos que já joguei, tanto as miniaturas (maravilhosas) quanto o tabuleiro e componentes, clean e bem temático. Mas de fato, é complexo, demorado, precisando de muito AP e sua mecânica principal de escolha de ações lembra muito Puerto Rico, que eu não gosto tanto. Há muitas coisas interessantes, o leilão escondido nas batalhas em particular achei bem divertido e estratégico, mas no geral Blood Rage já supre a ""gana"" por batalhas, sendo muito mais fácil e divertido, sem perder a estratégia."
2315,tracerbull,7,"Although Rising Sun carries a similar vibe to Blood Rage, it falls short in various aspects. Comparitive to Blood Rage, where its difficult to fall significantly behind, Rising Sun can often reflect scores miles ahead of other players with seemingly no way back in. Although Rising Sun occasionally scores higher high, I frequently find that being behind in Rising Sun feels much more common, and at the same time much more helpless in your actions. In addition, the alliance system can feel quite terrible if you are left alone, and more often than not I carry the burden to prevent other new players from having to experience the same degree of struggle. Although still possible, it makes it easy to kingmake or to put someone down if the group chooses to do so, and in fact encourages players to conduct such activity. Not to detract from the game, the bidding system is fantastic, and always a great time, but the political phase can feel like a drag, especially if you have terrible options each time they come around."

It's an interesting game. Four first-timer players, and it went long but we enjoyed ourselves. 

There appear to be problems though, but they likely wouldn't be fully revealed unless I had further plays. The guessing-game of the battle sequence, the difficulty of putting together a strong strategy when each clan has a ridiculous rule-breaking power, the apparent real lack of negotiation factor, the king-making..... these could be problems.

2333,trippp005,8,A great game that combines competition and social play.
2334,TRK27,6,"- I wish games would stop calling themselves ""area control games"" when holding territory and winning battles doesn't matter in them. For that matter it’s not really a negotiation or alliance-building game either as both elements feel superficial and arbitrary. 

    - In reality Rising Sun is basically a set collection worker placement game, where the “battles” are really auctions for various benefits - one of which is ""winning the battle"" (that is to say collecting the set collection tile) and don't feel like battles at all. It’s hard to quantify why, but even in Blood Rage the battles had the feeling of battles despite being relatively abstract. Rising Sun does not succeed in replicating that.

    - I also have problems with unbalanced player powers (the red player power comes to mind), with the poor-get-poorer honor track mechanism, and with the overall bloated, unfocused feeling of the game."
2335,tro6inson,7.5,"1st impressions: Really good. Very much a war game, but with the modern design touches to keep it moving along: limited decision set each turn, the ability to salvage something out of losing a battle, asymmetric powers, top-notch minis, greater rewards from conquering new territories rather than defending, small number of very connected territories. Despite this our 6 player learning game took 5 hours. 6 players did feel too much as the game was slow in places. In particular the blue dragonfly clan's special power slows the game down a lot. I'd say 4 player, no blue would be the ideal way to play - 5 player if you want a more negotiation-heavy experience. To be super critical I could say this is quite derivative of the modern dudes-on-a-map style, but that would be unfair as I think the diplomacy aspect is innovative and sets this game apart. Alliances last a turn (or less) and feel rewarding without being crucial. It also leads the players into NOT making broader/freeform alliances. Maybe it was just because we were new to the game, but I don't think it even occurred to any of us that we could be making alliances outside of the fairly strict rules provided. Quite fascinating, really - by providing a framework within which diplomacy and alliances happen they've actually reduced the impact of alliances on the game. Perhaps this is why I felt I had good diplomacy rounds?

Finally, two aspects of our game weren't impactful - Ronin and Betrayal. Hopefully it was just the way our game played out rather than a systemic issue with these two parts of the game.

Second impression: Ronin and betrayal again had little impact. Bonsai clan again massively underperformed. Ran a little longer than it should have. Alliances went to the first to speak rather than anything tactical or diplomatic. Fox clan again railroaded into a loki strat but pipped at the post by the table turning against them. If my third game plays the same I suspect I will be downgrading myrating by quite a bit."

The core mechanism is realy cool, i never seen that before ( what action you chose, everyone will do the same) but the fight system(1) the map(2) the tea ceremony is little bit dissapointment for me)

1. Fight system: I put coins in to my attack actions, ( make a seppuku / take a hostage / hire ronins/ and scoring ponts from fallen figures). My biggest problem whit that game, you dont need to win the battle. You could win easy if you are do a seppukku all the time. I wanna play a strategic war game, not a Suicide Squad Simulator. 

2. The map its looks just too simple.. its not could be a problem, but in this game everything is simple (except the buyable cards those give the game a nice assimetric feeling) simple actions, simple fight system. I wanted a way more complex board a tons of strategy options like in the Game of Thrones BG.

3. The tea ceremony is nice but you know, your partner will stab you in the back cuz its (not just fun) make him/her a advantageous whit the perfect timeing. 

I love this game but need some house rule for the smoother experience.

2358,uglywalrus,6,"This game is one of those non-party games experiences that varies widely depending on who you're playing with. The game suffers from the same issue as Cry Havoc, where it expects every player to be on the same relative skill level to be truly balanced.

While the design is elegant, it's also very prone to kingmaking (whether inadvertently or purposefully), with the punishments of bad decisions greatly outweighing the rewards from good decisions. This makes the game beginner unfriendly, not because it's difficult to pick up and learn (it's actually quite easy to teach), but because the new player invariably becomes dead-weight. In some other genres, a new player can make sub-optimal plays without being a major or insurmountable obstacle to the other players, but in this game, sub-optimal moves from a newbie can easily ruin another player's strategy and planning.

In short, this is often a game where the winner isn't the one who played the best, but just the one who was least disrupted by the other players."
2359,ultimoratio,6,"The game play is interesting with the blind bids and the several avenues of scoring. The alliance and negotiation is very bizarre and lacklustre. There isn't any incentive to go for one way or the other, which makes negotiation aspect of it non-existent. There's also no negotiation in terms of drawing borders on the map. The ones that were agreed are very obvious deals e.g. Player A won Province X and Player B and Province Y, so they made an agreement to switch places. The game play is also very disorienting to the theme, in which you lose the battle, but win loads of points by simply bidding on the correct action? Another bizarre thing."

There is a lot more going on in rising sun than blood rage which is great for those who like heavier games, but I prefer the easier to play and quicker blood rage. I also like Vikings more than samurais as a theme.

This game occupies an uncomfortable middle ground for me, generally I would rather play something lighter, but if I want a heavy wargame I prefer GOT slightly.

The combat in this game also has a wierd thematic gaffe where the winner gives all the money they spent on a fight to the loser, this is extremely wierd thematically and actually annoying during play as it can hose you pretty badly if someone hands your opponent a huge pile of cash.

The alliance system is pretty darn cool though and I like the scoring system a lot as well.

2381,Vantastic,7,"An epic game that is as much about divining the interconnectedness of the many design elements as it is about winning battles. While not nearly as much about negotiations as tenuous shifting alliances this is really a game about carving out the best path to points for the current game/board state. The good news is that the game/board state is never obvious as there are various interconnected elements that are dependent on nearly all player choices (all of which feel meaningful). The bad news is that opacity in game state and importance of nearly every player decision makes the game time sprawl. I enjoy every minute of it but this one can be an event between setup, play, and tear down. 

There are many paths to victory and some ability to pivot based on other player choices but the skill curve for this game means you can really jam up your game early on if you are careless or gamble big.

The battle system for this game is, hands down, the most interesting battle system I have ever encountered. It has so many choices, double-guessing, and impact (win or lose the battle) to make every battle feel like a contest of wills. However, all of those decision layers also make it an exhausting and sometimes overwhelming affair.

After more plays I find some of the design decisions more irritating than at first. While there is a lot going on in the game it rarely feels like I have many choices. Each player chooses very few mandates (which sometimes don't do all that much for them) and even though there are a lot of cards to purchase, many are so situational that they don't make a lot of sense unless the Kami that lets you buy cards is in the game. It takes a long time no matter how many players are in it and I just don't feel like it is as focused as other favorites in the genre, especially its superior sister Blood Rage."

Im a sucker for variable player powers, and here the clans really feel different to play. Combat is also really interesting, where you bid on certain rewards / outcomes. 

However I feel to game is only really interesting with at least 4 players or more and unfortunately it becomes too long and convoluted at that player count. 

I also don't like that the game forces the players to have battle in certain, depending on the player count, predetermined areas every round. The 'alliance' mechanic also feel a bit tacked on

Limited choices of actions each turn makes it relatively quick to pick up and play through, but the depth of the game is going to change depending on who you're playing with.  Tactical players will get a lot more from playing with tactical players who aren't afraid to start bribing one another."

+Extreme value for KS investment (with Daimyo pack stretch goals you easily are getting 2 for 1 return given current market price for base game)
+Offers decent variety on replay with seasonal cards and monsters that can be rotated in and out (again presuming one has Daimyo Pack and  / or expansions)- and yes, I agree with the some of the comments of others that speak to how certain combinations of seasonal cards and monsters (when acquired) can tip the game heavily, BUT (and this it the thing) the more you play, the more you come to identify which cards and monsters will work best for you and when, and I would challenge anyone that thinks it will always be the same thing twice (but I will concede that an experienced RS player will definitely have an advantage over a noob)
+Base mechanics are not as complex as they might initially appear, once we got through one play through the fundamentals were understood
+The blind bidding / combat system adds an enjoyable layer of depth - it's not enough to just have the biggest army, or the most ronin (mercenaries), or the most powerful monster, etc - you need $$ to put the tactics in play, and then hope that you don't get outmanoeuvred by the opposing player who will try to counter your bids and nullify your plans while advancing their own. Imagine an enemy general paying off your own mercenaries to ensure they don't fight for you. 
+Ultimately a game that isn't too tough to learn (again, give it one play through and most should be good) but with enough complexity to give you lots to think about as the game moves along.
+Determining victories in battle is not as challenging as some have suggested, once the tactical bidding has been revealed and worked through, there are only two (sometimes three) things to do, count out the strength of the armies on the province in question, and then take into account any modifying cards the players have in support of their armies. That's it. The only instance in which you have to engage the third step is in the event of a numerical tie in which case you take an extra 1/2 second to look at the honour track, with the victory going to the player with the highest honour. I'm guessing that this might seem overwhelming to some if you try drinking in the whole board at once, versus just focusing on the individual provinces where the battles play out one at a time. Admittedly there can be much to consider when you weigh out the order of battle (the order in which the ever changing list of provincial battles are resolved in) against your finances and any 'special' abilities and monsters granted to your clan via modifying cards, but this is irrespective of determining the individual battle victories themselves. 

-Craziest mechanic (that does mess with the theme a little) is the ability to take a monster hostage in battle. In our last play-through my opponent put one of the most powerful monsters in play, essentially a Godzilla type creature that begins the battle by destroying your castle(s), just like, well, Godzilla would. But it was a comical conclusion as my opponent had no money and I was able to easily pay for a successful 'hostage taking' and pulled this giant lizard monster out of the battle. My little band of soldiers took Godzilla hostage. It just seems...wrong. 
-As mentioned above, an experienced RS player will likely 'run the table' with newer players until they've had a chance to to experience how the different game mechanics come together (There are potential catch up mechanisms if you get off to a rocky start, but it took me a few play-throughs to identify them).   
-The 'playing time' is a gross underestimation, especially if you have 4+ at the table, you're easily looking at 3-4 hours (or more depending on how chatty people want to get as they negotiate or simply table talk).

2419,wallnip,6,"first play - 8. played KS version with all the exclusives. had a lot of fun with this due to the unique combat mechanic and possibly the group of friends i played with. betrayal was plenty but it only came out as the last political mandate selected. tea ceremony and alliance forming was quite wishy washy as everyone just picked whoever they were sitting beside, probably more gameplays would lead to more strategic alliances formed.
would definitely want to play this again.

8->7 thought about this game in depth and started to feel that me liking this was bcos of the crowd and negotiation, but gameplay itself, i think i may have concerns about it.

bought after 2 plays. KS all-in + tower season cards

third play: 7->6, alliance feels forced and weirdly artificial. RS doesnt shine well in odd player counts. certain mandate cards are provenly more useful than others at certain stage of the game. after 3 plays, i still have little idea on what i could have done better fo improve my next game. for an area control, i feel like i have no control. however, this remains a 6 because i just adore the battle system.

----------------------------------------------
+ really good components. wouldnt buy it if it wasnt a KS copy.
+ very cool bidding combat system. offers a lot of table top negotiation, bluffing and outwitting your opponent to win. 
+ interesting bidding concept for combat. whoever bids the highest get to perform that action. 


+/- season cards. need to read every single one of them to know what is good for you. will take time here especially if there are new players. mitigated by taking a photo of it and sending it to all to read while they're waiting.
+/- i find it strange why allies do not combine warriors' strengths during combat.
+/- clans have different abilities. some are useful, giving a really good head start, while others might just be average. 
+/- battles seems swingy because of the kidnap and sacrifice (loki strategy again!?) action. my giant fire dragon is going to be kidnap, are u kidding me!? but then again, it is because of these very actions available which makes RS an interesting game. it creates the opportunity to bluff ur opponent and play some mind games with them. love it.


- quite a bit of down time while each player discusses with their ally on the best political mandate to choose. Other players have nth much to do except wait.
- i would think this game does well only with even numbered players due to the alliance system. not being in an alliance is a really huge detriment.
- optimal at perhaps 4p only? otherwise not everyone has equal opportunities in choosing a mandate as only 7 are chosen every round.
- every clan feels like it is scripted to play in a certain way. yeah, sure, you may try other paths to victory, but the optimal path to victory for your clan is just one.
- luck of the draw. the main draw about RS was the mandates, but there in itself was where all the luck was concentrated at and this led to several frustrating rounds where i couldnt really do anything and my ally had draws which werent beenficial to me either."

The honour system is a simple tie-breaking mechanism, but it really adds a lot of depth to your decision-making process. I love games that force me to constantly second-guess my opponents and be a few steps ahead of them with my plans. 

The retail version feels like a complete game so don't worry if you missed out on kickstarter extras - you'll have a lot of fun with just the ""core set"". 

As a side note - I rate this game purely on its mechanisms, I don't care about the minis. In fact, I think that the monsters are ridiculously oversized and get in the way of playability (I had similar issues with Blood Rage). They do look cool, but as ""toys"" (or something to admire for a while outside the game), not as actual functional components.

[b]/update:[/b] One thing that concerns me is the fact that the strength of certain clans is hugely dependant on the random layout of the Kami tiles. Bonsai clan is much weaker with no additional possibilities of purchasing cards and significantly stronger with such Kami in play. I'm far from saying that there's a lack of balance in this game, but those swings in potential are rather weird. 

[b]//update, February 2019:[/b] Downgraded from 8 to 7. The more I play it the less satisfying the gameplay is. The Bonsai clan is a joke in a 5-player setting, you almost have no control over the state of the game. The combat is where all the interesting mind-games are happening, the rest of the season is too limited and straightforward when it comes to the decisions you make. It'a a good game, but when it comes to Eric Lang designs I prefer Chaos In the Old World. Still, I'll gladly play Rising Sun when someone suggests it (but only with 4 players), I just feel no desire to own it anymore, especially since most players in my group don't care for this game or simply dislike it."

Japan (Nippon) is called Land of the Rising Sun because the sun rises in the East and to the Chinese, it looked like the sun was rising over Japan. Nippon is translated into English as Land of the Rising Sun. I swear, SJWs are the absolute biggest, most transparent, glass jawed, haters on the planet. As for the use of the red sun half exposed on a horizon, not exactly the imperial flag of Japan. Look it up, ya big babies. For the person who points out that it is part of the Edo period, good on ya, you're correct and that period happens to be feudal warlords (daimyōs) allying, betraying, and fighting each other, a theme central to this game. Finally, before you go thinking that I don't have a reason to be upset about an actual Imperial Japanese Flag, I had a Great Grand Father and Great Uncle who were killed on the Bataan Death March.

I like how rich the game is: plenty of original aspects, intriguing decisions, tense moments. I still have an issue with the length of setup and tear down but the general rhythm is very fast and exciting.
It really requires a lot of games to be appreciated.
......................................
My first and so far only experience with RS is an interrupted game (after 2 ""years""). One of us explained the game, somehow poorly, and the remaining three didn't understan much of what was going on, to the point that after 2 years the scores were 34,4,2,2. 

The miniatures are nice but, as usual, completely useless: they don't add anything to the game play and I don't need them to enjoy a game more. If you like miniatures though, it's a wonderful game.
What about the game itself? It's absolutely not bad, I like the original (at least for me) war mechanic. It adds a lot of tension and it requires planning and double guessing. Also, the fact that you lose all your money after each year is truly intriguing. Besides, you are forced to visit all Japan, you can't just have a couple strong territories. The divinty you summon play a nice role while i am not completely convinced by the additional cards.
All in all, I consider my first game just a long hands-on tutorial and I hope to play it again."
2439,weow,10,"Great game, albeit can be quite long with 5 or more players. I would recommend this one at 3 or 4 players. It feels a bit imbalanced at times and I am still trying to figure out the optimal strategies. This game is one game you should try play with the same group of people as it takes a few plays to get the hang of it. I've had many discussions with friends about relevant strategies and optimal plays, and we like to debrief after games to understand what went on. 

At the core of it is a euro type dudes on a map game with deep satisfying decisions and many different paths towards victories. Asymmetrical clans also help with the variety of strategies which can be implemented.

This game is unique enough to keep in my area control collection. I really like the variations of the monsters and units and the large variety of market cards that change up things in the game to keep it fresh. On top of that it is just a gorgeous game to behold, they really outdid themselves with the art on the board. 

Negative Final Thoughts 

There are a few things I’m not personally a fan of however. Like I don’t really enjoy the battle system that’s setup with the bidding and deception, it just feels awkward to me even though it is interesting. The board state is very rarely as it seems, which I think is just the games design but there are so many things that can make a battlefield super complex super quickly. This is especially true during the last season when a number of players have bought market cards that enhance certain aspects of their units. Which of course is extremely hard to track at higher player counts. This almost makes the game more of a gamble when playing it as you never really know what a “good” move would be UNLESS you spend time keeping track of each players stuff…..which increases the down time. Again I will keep the game as I do think it’s super unique and I love the theme and artwork but I have other area control games that I would pick to play over this one.

It was actually relatively painless to learn the rules, and did not take that much time (A design skill Eric Lang seems to excel at). I love the aspect of negotiating your way through it. I like that each faction has different abilities. And use of money to determine battle, with a system a lot like Cry Havoc was interesting. I liked that if you knew you were most likely to lose a battle, you could be benefitted if you chose a different option (i.e. sepeku). Overall our group had a lot of fun figuring it out. 

I do feel like this game is WAY too long. It took us 4 hours, and we weren't really struck by a lot of AP. I feel like this is a mechanical issue. For Example, When you take the Train action, you search through the ENTIRE deck, which means every person has to go through it, reading everything carefully and then decide. I get that the designers are going for complete OPEN information, but wouldn't a card draft similar to Blood Rage speed this up some? Or why not draw a certain amount of cards from the top of the deck and choose from those. I feel like we could have shaved a LOT of game time down simply by doing that. I almost feel if we play it again, we add that as a variant. 

Other than that, I will revisit this review on further plays."
2467,wookiemart,9,"Replay value for me, is a big factor in deciding what games I purchase . 
This game has it in spades.
Asymmetrical faction abilities, Kami variations, different season decks...
They have also nailed the theme on the head with this one, feudal Japan has never had such style and flare I don't think.

A warning though, for those of you who look at all the minis and think this is a wargame, think again. If you were disappointed by Scythe for the same reasons then keep walking or come up with your own set of skirmish rules because while Rising Sun is many, MANY things, a wargame it is definitely NOT.

The only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because I'm a believer in the idea that nothing is perfect and we should always leave a little bit of room for improvement."

Played this in every player count. Its a really fun game with lots of interesting things happening and decisions. Maybe one of the most fun games played with a good group. But it also has some major flaws like the long setup and play time as well as some REAL inbalances concerning cards and end game scoring. Some monsters look cool but they never touch the table in advanced groups because they literally just suck. I really wish this had better playtesting.

Since Blood Rage is quicker and more streamlined they both have their unique values.

The problem that I've found, however, is that it's a game about war (it is most emphatically not a ""wargame"") that doesn't reward military success.  Instead, after many plays, the most reliable way to stack victory points and win increasingly looks to be via combos of season cards, preferably coupled with suicide and/or writing some poems.

Which is . . . different?  It's dulled my enjoyment of the game considerably.  If I wanted to play a game focused on triggering card combos, I could have gotten a deckbuilder without having to pay for a pile of admittedly pretty plastic."

Ah, Rising Sun, you unwieldy beast of a game. Where to even begin scrutinizing you? There's some things you do oh so well. Other things not so much. 

You're far too long for starters. Usually the third season feels more a matter of finishing the game despite the entire room feeling burnt out. You're also over-produced, with miniatures that have no business being as large as they are, considering their physical strength is often the same as a lowly bushi's. Your theme is discordant. Some of the mechanics, such as Honor, tie really well into it. But even under the aegis of ""Mythic Fantasy"" or whatever you want to call it, it's quite evident that this is a game about Japan that isn't by anyone Japanese.

Your combat is pretty fun though. Genuine white-knuckled gambles going on there. And hoo boy, those over-sized miniatures. Gorgeous. Mixed feelings abound. In a pinch I rather play [i]Blood Rage[/i]. Still, I come back to you, upon occasion. I suspect this may continue. This somewhat aloof relationship we got going.

Worse than Blood Rage (which I realy enjoy). Though the mechanics of self sacrifice for VP is interesting, it is not unique (but rather a common feature with Blood Rage).

Having played the game mostly with 5 players I get frustraded by the odd selection of ~strategy card~, which determines initative.

I have to admit, that I experienced a certain disconnect my first couple of games: the whole presentations, the recruitment, the units, etc. makes you feel like playing an area control game. However, in order to win, you need to pursue point generators, instead - which sometimes have nothing to do with winning battles or holding land. So, it is hard (especially for new players) to get a grasp of what you have to do - what you are playing/fighting for. Once you get an understanding of how the cogs of this game can be turned in your favour, it really comes to live, however.

As someone who has not been traditionally impressed with many of Eric Lang’s designs, Rising Sun is one of the first that has truly disrupted this narrative and is one that legitimately leaves me excited to see what’s next for him.  In fact, Rising Sun is one of very, very few games that implements radical, prescribed asymmetry in a way that feels interesting and doesn’t leave me terribly worried about the balance of the various powers.  

While some of the races in the game are certainly more powerful in comparison to others, their advantages can be very easily discerned from the beginning, and I feel that this makes it much more likely that the players are able to make informed decisions during the key “tea ceremony” section of the game.  Indeed, the system as a whole is reasonably straight-forward, with players allying, selecting actions, and then possibly scoring sections on the map or triggering the use of powerful Kami abilities to further influence the outcome of the battles.  This streamlined system does a phenomenal job of providing the players difficult decisions and plenty of places to negotiate directly and indirectly, as they jockey for control of key regions on the map.  These decisions are made even more interesting by the inclusion of a fascinating blind-bidding battle system, in which players spend money for the privilege of influencing the overall outcome and securing points for both the short and long terms.  The system certainly introduces uncertainty, but so much of it is calculable, and players can really weigh one another’s incentives reasonably well most of the time.  The rule that forces the winner to pay the loser all of the cash they used in bidding in the battle also helps keep players guessing, running risk-calculations in their heads in hopes of figuring out just how much they need a certain action versus how much they’ll give to their opponent(s) to secure it.  The battles work effectively almost no matter how many players there are, and this system is the heart of what makes the game compelling.  

Now, even with all this praise, the game isn’t without its share of places to critique.  For one, even though the races are dramatically different, the game can feel reasonably stale after a handful of plays, as players fall into patterns of play or decisions in negotiation seem obvious and/or forced.  In addition, the variety of the season cards helps to encourage players to try new strategies, but my experience has been that they don’t do quite as much to incentivize radically different approaches and that the big scoring cards in the final season are often unfairly passed out to the players based on who choses the action to buy from the market (since purchases simply go clockwise from this person).  In addition, the number of actions isn’t evenly divisible for 4 or 5 players, meaning that some players get more or fewer action choices than other, which feels oddly unaccounted for in the balancing of the races.  Still, if players are aware of these weird edge cases, they should be able to balance them reasonably well among themselves.  Overall, Rising Sun is an interesting dudes on a map, negotiation-heavy game that reminds me most of Cosmic Encounter, in fact.  It’s a good design, and one I’d happily revisit, even if I wouldn’t want to play it too many times back to back.  Definitely worth a play!"
