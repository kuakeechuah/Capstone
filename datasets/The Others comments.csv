[b]What makes it special?[/b]

* Dark, apocalyptic theme: heroes are supposed to die
* Corruption system (risk management for additional boni)
* Reaction system: the Sin player can interrupt the other players (uncertainty, surprise)
* Challenging: both sides must play for the win (tense decision-making)
* Balanced mix between strategy, tactics, and luck

[b]Pros:[/b]

+ Artwork 
Good character drawings. The rest is rather simple: the map tiles look rather generic. 

+ Theme
Dark, apocalypse, sins, expandable life. The Sin player constantly tries to lure the heroes into gifts that come with a benefit but also a drawback.

+ Components
Plenty of great detailed miniatures, player boards, custom dice.

+ Modular map 
The map is based on the scenario. Each scenario offers two different maps (replayability, variability).

+ Variable scenarios
Several scenarios have different rules, objectives, 2 different maps, and different story paths chosen by the heroes (replayability, variability). There are different types of scenarios that change the overall goal for the heroes.

+ Customizable Sin player
The Sin player chooses the Sin including its unique action card deck and the acolytes (special unit) to play with (replayability, variability). 

+ Sin cards and hand management
The Sin player has a unique deck of cards. 
Sins cards contains a combination of potentially devastating one-off events, personal objectives with awesome rewards should they be fulfilled, and even simple enchanments that affect the ongoing game state from there onwards.
The cards often have to be played at the beginning of a Hero's action, but only take effect if something occurs during that Hero's turn that would trigger the effect. This is great because the Sins player gets to set up traps for the Hero players, but traps of a very particular and thematic variety - traps of desire. The Hero may have wanted to do something with their turn, but now the Sin has played a card that, if not immediately dealt with, will give the Sin too much power to ignore. 
The cards which give the Sins some awesome boost often have a choice on them: one which is posited not to the Sins player, but to the Hero players! Again, this is another mode of trapping the Heroes in their own desires. 
MANY of those cards in the Sins player's hand allows them to force players to take corruption,

+ Unique characters
Each character has different stats and one unique ability plus additional upgrade cards (variability, replayability). Additional equipment (upgrade cards) can be collected in a scenario to boost a character. There are different types of characters that play quite differently.

+ Some exploration
Hidden tokens on the board. There is a little uncertainty element, a token may be an objectives, a bad events, or an item. Some tokens will effect an area like causing wounds by fire, boosting enemy monsters, or monster spawn points.

+ City tokens 
They can be placed once-per game by a player to grant special effects (right timing).

+ Cleansing
Heros can spend time and actions to clean an area from bad effect tokens which may help in the long run.

+ Reaction system:
The Sin player can react to other players with moving monsters or playing Sin cards. It is the only way how a Sin player can take actions. The Sin's player actions are limited by the number of left-over reaction tokens. There is one mechanically restriction that only the active player can be attacked by an interrupt.

+ Competitive dungeon crawler
The Sin player has a lot of options and has to play well in order to win unlike most other dungeon masters of other dungeon crawlers. Both sides (Sin and Heroes) seem very balanced.

+ Corruption management
Players can take tempting corruption to gain additional boni, however, it is risky in the long-term. If taking a wound, the hero player decides what bonus to cover, either the weak first or the last strong, however, the weak are likely triggered more often over the course of the game.

+ Simultaneous combat system
The combat system is dice-based and simple. Both sides simultaneously roll and determine hits and parries. 
The combat is tense because monsters have to be killed outright: take all health or nothing happens (monsters loose all inflicted wounds after a combat round).
However, the combat is also quite simplistic and offers only little mitigation and decision-making.

+ No player elimination
If a hero dies, the player can pick a new hero from the left-over heroes. If there is no more hero to choose from, the Sin player wins.

+ Some team-work
Players get bonus combat die when they are located together. Some hero abilities grant buffs to other players.
Monsters get bonus dice in locations with pentagram tokens.

+ Apocalypse track 
It adds additional bad effects or unlocks new Sin powers. It basically adds time pressure to the heroes.

+ Mix between tactical and strategical decision-making
Avoid damage, avoid killing acolytes, block players, take corruption, go suicide to achieve the goal.

+ Tense endings most of the time 
The game is tense for both sides due to the balanced game and boss fights. Heroes constantly try to prevent their characters from dying.

+ Simple turns
Each player has two actions: move / activate. This, the simultaneous combat, and the interrupt system reduces downtime between turns a lot.

+ Easy to teach and learn
Simple, streamlined game structure and rules (no corridor blocking, simple line of sight, simple movement). There are little exception rules. It is quite easy to teach compared to similar dungeon crawlers.

+ Scales well with all player counts
The heroes are not that complex so that one player can play multiple characters.

[b]Neutrals:[/b]

# Language dependent

# Exploding / burst dice combat system
There are ""exploding"" dice (roll an additional die if an exploding symbol shows up which cause a chain reaction). Bursting dice can be very swingy but it happens rather rarely: if lucky, a highly wounded player may kill a big monster, if unlucky, a healthy hero may be instantly slain by a monster (tense, surprise, bad luck). However, it often creates memorable moments.

# Skill checks by rolling dice
Simple push your luck mechanism without much decision-making or mitigation.

# Luck of the roll
Since there is so much dice rolling, it should balance out over the course of the game.

# Plenty of expansion content available
Expensive if you want it all. They all add some variety to the game without changing it much. This keeps game overall balanced but there are no fundamental changes in the gameplay or rules.

# The base game comes with 7 heroes and 2 of 7 Sin characters
The base game offers already a lot of readability and variability. However, once you like the game, you are likely want it all.

# No campaign
The game is scenario-based, so you do not need a fixed game group with the same players.

# The game is very focused on combat

# Suboptimal team compilations make the game considerably harder for the heroes

# Quite constant playing time (90 mins, max 120 mins)

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Quite generic story

- A lot of roll to resolve
No my favorite game mechanic, but okay combined with the other decision-making here.

- More dice in the box would have been great
However, more dice are included in some expansion boxes and additional dice pack is available.

- Big game box (like Blood Rage or Rising Sun)
There are a lot of different plastic minis to store.

- No reference sheet for the tokens
Available in the BGG file section.

[b]Thoughts:[/b]
Both the Sins player and the Heroes must deal with randomness in almost all their actions to accomplish any given task. The Heroes can, at any point, however, mitigate that chaos by giving into corruption; the more they corrupt themselves, the more power they have over their fate. However, the more corruption they take, the more they open themselves to direct influence by the Sins player.
In The Others, Its not a matter of ""rolling well"", but of choosing when and how much to take risks and when to take control. Indeed, the question, the game posits is - who among us is, in fact, in control here?
Despite the determining factor of the dice, the game still feels like a puzzle to me. How can you use your actions in the best way possible to achieve your goals, block your enemies and avoid as much damage as possible. You need to find a balance between getting damage, corruption points and exposing yourself to danger in order to reach your goals. This means that sometimes you’ll have to sacrifice a character on a suicide mission because you need to reach your goal. 
The players need to realize that the heroes are at a disadvantage. The heroes are – without a doubt - weaker than the Sin player. For me a downside for me as well as the fact that the game feels quite abstract when playing. You’ll need to sit down, relax and really think your strategies through. If you don’t, you’ll lose the game. These strategies will cause quite some downtime. I’ve played The Others with 2 or 3 players most of the times and with those player numbers it’s a great game. And because most characters are easy to understand and play, you can easily play two characters at once (unlike Star Wars: Imperial Assault).

I don't like, however, how the game seems (and this is only after one play, mind, so maybe not every encounter is like this) to create an end-state of throwing 'missiles' at one another.  The Sins player, camped out in a fortified area with a lot of help.  The agents need to kill the last guy.  They send someone in, decked out as much as possible, who deals a chunk of damage, then inevitably dies to the counter-attack.  Repeat until the game is over.  That's a VERY dull way to end the game."

109,Cavern_11,4,"[1 play] Some good ideas (corruption to boost actions of heroes but hurting them at the end) but the story is very light and the feeling is finally quite usual : move 2 spaces, target a monster, gather a pool of dice using equipment and abilities, roll these dice, count the hits vs the defenses, kill the monster or not, start again. Moreover, the heroes are very fragile (the goal of the sin player is to kill them all) and you can't develop them through the game : one heavy reaction and you are dead. And a little disappointed by the graphic approach of the minis and the sins, I understand that they wanted an horrific approach but all the avatars are somehow similar, big mountains of flesh and tentacles.

French edit : Ce jeu est une de mes grosses déceptions de l'année. Même si je ne suis guère un fan des gros jeux de figurines (demandant trop d'investissement en termes de temps, voir Conan), celui-ci partait sur une idée vraiment sympa : les sept péchés capitaux.

Or, le traitement qui en est fait est, comme toujours, glauque et très consensuel : on fait des bestioles informes et tentaculaires, très proches les unes des autres et donc les pouvoirs ne sont guère inspirés.

Au niveau de la mécanique, c'est du grand classique et, même si nous avions gagné la partie que j'ai faite, je ne garde aucun souvenir de ce qui s'est passé pendant celle-ci, ni coup d'éclat, ni coup de loose. Je ne sais même plus quel pêché nous avons repoussé... Pourtant, je me souviens parfaitement de ma première partie de Mice & Mystics ou de Conan.

Et c'est là que le jeu pêche par excès d'orgueil, par manque de gourmandise, simplement en bafouant cette envie du joueur qui, renonçant à l'avarice en quête d'un jeu luxueux, se retrouve avec un truc bien édité certes, mais trop paresseux. Point de colère donc, mais une déception certaine."
110,charlest,5,"This is a OK game that has a few things going for it. The Corruption mechanic is the main draw, it allows you to time your pacing and explode with big turns and some drama. 

The mission system is also neat as it presents branching objective choices for players mid-session. This is clever and works well.

Love the Lang exploding dice too.

Otherwise though it does seem like a souped up Zombicide. When it drags and gets repetitive is when it's at its weakest. It can definitely overstay its welcome at times by a half hour or so. 

Miniatures are great and the gameplay is a bit mediocre overall. Really borderline on being something of quality but probably just shy. It certainly didn't kick me in the teeth like Blood Rage.

But this game can be setup and played in around 2 hours and feel complete. There are totally 7 sins with different scenarios that will be coming.  This is a game that will be easy to put out on table from time to time. 
The miniatures blew me away, the theme could generate a stunning atmosphere. The game play was great with smooth mechanics. Typical dice rolling Ameritrash but with a lots of fun.  I think it's game Eric should be proud of and become his trademark of his design.  I'm glad I own the KS copy and I think the game can get better with some new stories.  Apocalypse expansion figures are just catching my eyes but not necessary from the story development and game play.
7 sins...玩了七次7 sins, 此時也可對此game 作一小總結, 若在遊戲中經常被罪打跨，不要氣餒。當英雄真是不容易呢！7場戰役中英雄較為有把握的只有紅色情景。其他情景英雄要勝利可以但一定要精確計算、要犧牲、要寧願不打來耗sin player reaction, 要有裝備和運氣。本人玩七場中英雄險勝一場(last battle)而穩勝2場 (red)。
整體遊戲規則簡單, 易上手易上檯，玩完多次情景仍歷歷在目, 難得一見的好game.  各人技能算易理解也没有line of sight 和走格的煩惱。怪物死亡是1 與 0 的層面，怪獸沒有受傷可減省記傷麻煩。英雄受傷和腐败記帳容易。一目了然。自願腐敗系統配合主題一絕。雖你可批評此遊戲不太平衡。英雄難逃罪的魔劫。但又如何? 英雄是要有雖千萬人吾往矣之氣道、英雄也要有看淡人間生與死坦然面對槍林逼的勇氣。我給予此遊戲好評並在收藏不賣系列之一。
7 sins...加上Apocalypse expansion, Sins player 可以做 dominate a district 動用地圖炮傷所有一格內的英雄一血。FAITH team可要多一至二名成員的生命才可完成任務。FAITH team 要用血跑mission 避免非不必要的正面交鋒。"

Seems to offer just enough choices through dice manipulation, card play, and corruption decisions to not feel like a totally random dice fest. Unfortunately has become a slog in most of our games and is ultimately unsatisfying to every player I've played it with. Sold after 4 games. Has good ideas mixed in with a game I don't care for with scenarios feeling very abstracted and dog pile strategies feeling like the only answer for the sins player at times."

181,Dr Locrian,8,"Imo the best one vs all game of last year, more innovative than Conan (the overlord system is less fun perhaps) and more fully fleshed out with an okay rule book, vs conan's infuriatingly vague rule book, massive replayability out of the box - though the addition of the various sins doesn't add that much. I am yet to try the apocalypse Expansion. The game scales well from two to five. It's fun to play both sides. I think the game is balanced; I don't really think that Lang makes unbalanced games, I think that his games often take a few plays to grok the best way to play and the extent to which you respond to your opponents - Blood rage. 

I like this game so much I made a how to play video 

https://youtu.be/YGobkhuz8F0


The theming could be better, I'd rather that this had had a Black Plaguesque theme instead of the faux Clive barker vibe that it has going, perhaps even with some cross over - I am dreaming there and just nitpicking. Recommended."
182,Dracilic,6.5,Wish I had kickstarted it. Just lost out on so much content. Due to the 1 vs All mechanic and the theme islt is pretty hard to get to the table. Which makes it difficult to justify buying more content.
183,DrRednek,7,"I would rate this higher, but it feels that 7 is appropriate. ;)"
184,DrunkDwarves,9,"An interesting game because it doesn't do what you'd expect. It isn't a shoot-'em-up style game, more slow moving in ways. The way the Sins player interrupts the other side is brilliant and prevents the typical scripting  of turns in other all vs one games. I do wish there was a bit more to differentiate the sins from one another. The art is awesome though there is a disconnect between the art and the components as if two designers were at odds over the look of the game. Solid though I will admit there are some longevity concerns since there is variety but it is subtle. "
185,DrWorm331,8,This is a very nice production that plays great! My only complaint is that the sniper class seems hard to utilize. Lots of options and replay options here.
186,DuneTiger,6,"Not sure how I feel about the Others, so I'll consider this a provisional rating.  I don't find it complex, but I do feel that despite being a minis game, it is lacking in the tactical department.  I understand that Lang's design goal was to have the Others play fast and hard, and for a minis game, it succeeds in that department.  But is it fun?  I dunno.

First, I'd say if you dig Zombicide, you will probably dig the Others.  Like that game, I found the Others to be a little too ""fuck it"".  Allow me to explain.

I am not talking about Lang throwing everything into a blender and calling it a day, but rather that the choices that players - both the sin and the heroes - will make revolve around the philosophy of ""fuck it"".  There's no real grand strategy that you can play here nor is their room to exercise tactical prowess - instead, the focus is to get as much gear as you can and dive headlong into danger in order to bust through the objectives as fast as you can.  Failure to take that mindset means you will die.  What this means is that you will typically eschew interesting characters like Rose for beefy characters like Thorley; in other words, you'll find that despite the bevy of characters available in the box, if you want to win as the heroes, your choices are made for you and the ""crappier"", more interesting folks are sent to the reserves.

Now I must include a disclaimer here - this is based on two plays of the recommended scenario and perhaps the other ones are more engaging, but ultimately, as the sin player, I did not feel rewarded for winning the game.  Instead, I felt like it was an inevitability.  The rules allow the sin player to simply pile up on the heroes and throw a metric shitload of dice.  While the heroes won't die instantly (they are quite tough), it just feels like without some genius play and a lot of luck, the heroes are not going to have a good time.

At any rate, I haven't written this one off just yet as I respect Lang as a designer and know he's capable of some serious awesomesauce, but as of this writing, I haven't seen it yet in the Others."

Ultimately, the Sins player has a massive advantage, especially in the ""first' scenario. Eventually, they just have so many dice that any attack is guaranteed to KO a hero, and you only get seven in the box. Due to how loose the rules are, there's really nothing to stop the Sins player from guarding the objectives tightly and preventing the heroes from getting anything of value."

We played partway through the first game against sloth and honestly its really not a very good game.

In the first half we (players) were struggling against the monsters with them rolling a lot more dice and corrupting/wounding us a lot whilst we were mostly ineffective. ... and the sin player wasn't even trying. In the second half, once we stabilized and managed to get/keep a bit of equipment the sloth player simply piled all the monsters into a space resulting in insta-death for anyone entering that space (seriously 15 dice Vs maybe 5 dice) its just not fun!

Lots of rules questions and clarifications and rule book flicking slowed this right down to a crawl and honestly it was such a slog that we all (sin player included) gave up as it was no fun. There needs to be a summary sheet and or a clear easy to reference FAQ, neither of which we had."

Komoly döntések mindkét oldalon, még akkor is ha sok a kockadobálás. Hangulatos elemek, nagyszerűek a scenariok is. Érdekes módon hangulatosabbnak érzem ezeket a jól összerakott egyszeri forgatókönyveket, mint a kampány módokat általában. Ja, és rengeteg variáció van a retail dobozban, átlagos gémernek végtelen. 20-30 játékot simán bele lehet tenni ismétlés nélkül.

In my humble opinion, this is buy far one of the best games they have created.  I am writing this comment 4 years after the creation of the game, and my group and I still find it very enjoyable!  The system is very sound, the evil and good teams are very diverse, and the scenarios are very well constructed.  As cool as co-op games are these days, The Others is actually a ""two"" player game.  That is, one player plays the evil faction, while the other players play the good faction.  What prompted me to write this was the arrival of my Death May Die kickstarter.  After playing a game with my group, we could not help but thing how similar Death May Die is to The Others!  And that is fantastic!  DMD is like an upgrade from The Others as befits the Cthulhu universe.  What is cool about The Others is the concept of teams.  You have the 7 deadly sins constituting their own teams.  While the good guys have Beta, Gamma, Delta, etc.  Of course, you can mix and match, but it's always cool to have them ""stick together"".  In 2016, the price was well worth it, and CMON's offerings versus price was very generous.  Absolutely fantastic game CMON!  And thanks for its successor: Death May Die!"
238,Gamer_Dog,5.5,"Only 1 play, which isn't enough to form a strong opinion. I'm so-so on these types of hybrid euro-thematic games as I generally prefer strategy titles. That caveat aside, Cool Mini does a great job with the miniatures, and most of the production is quite good. Cards and a few other aspects are meh. The game system isn't all that complicated, although I expect there will be a few clarifications/errata given the number of moving pieces. Overall, I thought it was an ok game experience. Most of the decision making is whether to use limited actions or costly bonuses to try and achieve, or improve your chances of achieving, an objective. That aspect is well done. That said, dice and cards rule the game, and you'd have to get into the thematic aspect to really appreciate the experience, or not mind a lot of chaos from dice results. Assuming you enjoy that sort of game, it appears to have good replay and a nice game system."

272,happyjosiah,8,"I've now played Gluttony and Envy and enjoyed both games. It reminds me a lot of Zombicide (which I also like) but that also makes me feel a bit jaded towards CoolMiniOrNot's products. You can see this as a positive or a negative, but it almost feels like they have a certain basic rule set that things just expand off of. Flying Frog is another company that does this same type of thing.

In any case, this is an enjoyable game, but probably very expensive for collectors as you really don't have the whole game without all seven sins, now do you? There is massive variety though as any of these sins can be used with any of the scenarios and each one plays very differently. It seems like the kind of game that could be played weekly with the same group with good results. 

There are tough choices on most turns, it is thrilling to take down a nasty monster, and I like that it is adversarial (there is an overlord) instead of a pure co-op. A solid effort, and one I'd always be happy to play, but that I personally feel would be redundant and not worth the money for my own collection."

323,jesusramos,8,"Take control of the FAITH agents or one of the seven deadly sins and duke it out. The sins player is playing as a reactionary player which makes for an interesting dynamic with how actions work.

There's an enrage timer mechanic built into the game where if the FAITH players take too long the sin player just gets stronger and stronger. It's a good way to avoid trying to drag out the game and really gives that feeling that the sin is taking over.

The corruption mechanic is great and allows you to partake in some power if only for a brief moment. Really adds to the theme and picking when to take corruption well can really swing the game in your favor as the FAITH player."

352,KageSasurai,7,"A great take on the players vs DM style of gaming which I generally don't like, however this game fixes several issues I have with the genre. Firstly it balanced the game so neither the DM nor players have to pull their punches. Secondly it eliminates the DM's ""turn"" in favor of giving him reactions to the players actions. A great design, the greatest flaw of which is the number of expansions and cost requires one to spend as much as it would cost to make a 1500pts 40k army in order to have the complete game."

355,Karatevater,9,"This game is actually amazing if you don't mind the heavy RNG reliance in fights, but there's quite a problem with how the Sin mechanics work. There's a specific playstyle that is almost always optimal for the Sin player and once you've figured it out games tend to always play out same-y. Game setup is also quite a chore, but that doesn't deduct from the rating.

Edit: After 10+ games of this I have to revise my initial rating of 7, this game is really great with diverse tactical decision-making and lots of replayability. The RNG can be mitigated by smart decisions and keeps the game fresh with some XCOM-style holy shit moments."

But even considering that, the theme is a convoluted fantasy that's a product of someone else's imagination and which just isn't engaging to me at all.  While the mini's are somewhat interesting, the rest of the artwork from the board tiles to the character art are just unappealing (but perhaps that's the intent given the theme)."
360,Kentharious,6,"This is Pandemic meets Arcadia Quest. This game will not be what you expect it to be. While it looks like a dungeon crawl-esque game, I assure you its absolutely not. You go around dealing with crisis/objectives, exactly like Pandemic, but with dice mechanics similar to Arcadia Quest.

Az biztos, hogy egyedi megjelenése, hangulata van, de nekem nem lesz a kedvencem."
363,Keymaster of Gozer,5.5,"Yeah, it's one of those games where you chuck a bunch of dice (of which they don't include enough to actually take your turn - boo!). When they come up hits, you cheer. When they come up misses, you curse whoever invented dice in the first place. So, the usual reductive Ameritrash fuckery. Art is cool at least. Playing the heroes felt lousy, like you're always stepping in dog shit. My wife said playing Sin didn't feel great either, since they get far fewer turns than the forces of FAITH. Seems unbalanced as well - Sin monsters feel overpowered. Not recommended."
364,Kiba17Inuzuka,8,"Friend in my playgroup owns this, we've played this game more than a lot of others we both own. Love the ""nemesis"" play type with 1 friend vs the rest. Even when the game seems lost either side has a chance to come back with some good rolls or well timed draws."

366,kingmaker5,7.5,"One versus all scenario-based game which reminds me of Descent 2.0.  The most interesting thing about it is the corruption mechanism in which you need to bump up your corruption to defeat the boss monster, which puts your character on the brink of ruin.  Nice minis and theming."
367,KingRobtheIV,6,"2 things right off the bat, this game has gorgeous models and its completely broken. 
The models for this game are super detailed and really a pleasure to look at, use and especially paint. 
The game ""cannot"" be won by the heroes. The game is balanced so hard in the sins favour that, that play doesn't really even need to be around or paying attention to win the game. The game is so easy for the sins player, they can win EVERY game in 4 or 5 turns without any thought. This broken mechanic is based on the fact that the heroes die and hurt themselves doing anything while the sins have no consequences and that the controller and avatar (rules as written) can be summoned during the summoning phase. So even if the heroes dont kill any sin monsters, come the end of turn 2, the apocalypse track allows the avatar to be summoned in. Who can kill a hero every turn by itself.
While the game is fun, and each scenario is unique, without serious and heavy house rules, the sin player will win each time so you just play a game to see how far you can get before losing. Its similar to gloomhaven on the most difficult setting without the campaign aspect. 
I would rate this game 9/10 for the models, 7/10 for missions and creativity and -900/10 on balance. If anyone says ""either player can win"" without house rules, they are either a) lying or b) playing the game wrong."

379,kytah,N/A,"In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).

The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH’s victory."

This is a simple and straightforward DM game which doesn't really have a campaign or leveling up. Everything is a one shot adventure. The theme isn't overly compelling or interesting for me which detracts from my interest although the minis are nice as is typical of CMON. I just find games requiring a DM challenging to get to the table as a whole as people with whom I game don't want to have 3/4 vs 1 as a rule."

387,Lecaro,7.5,"The Others ist ein Dungeoncrawler mit Overload.
Anders als in anderen Spielen der gleichen Gattung gibt es in diesem Spiel mehrere Missionsabfolgen, die die guten Spieler erledigen müssen um zu gewinnen.
Ebenfalls anders als bei den Anderen: Es spielen immer alle Helden mit, aber nur ein Teil davon ist aktiv im Spiel. Stirbt ein Held, nimmt sich der betroffene Spieler einer der übrigen Helden, der dann wieder von vorne startet. Sobald ein Held ersetzt werden muss, aber keiner mehr in der Reserve liegt gewinnt die Sünde das Spiel!
Jeder Held erhält zwei Aktivierungsmarker und kommt damit zweimal pro Runde zum Zug. Ein Held an der Reihe führt immer genau eine Bewegung und eine Aktion in beliebiger Reihenfolge durch. Zusätzlich darf jeder Held einmal pro Runde eine Stadtaktion nutzen, welche dann mit einem Marker markiert wird.
Nach jedem Heldenzug kann sich der Overloard entscheiden auf diesen Zug zu reagieren. Dazu muss er einen seiner 3-4 Reaktionsmarker aktivieren und darf dann ein Monster bewegen und den aktiven Spieler angreifen.
Nachdem jeder Held zweimal aktiviert wurde endet die Runde und es tauchen neue Monster auf, schlimme Effekte passieren und die Sünde erhält zusätzliche Karten auf die Hand, mit der sie allerhand anstellen kann.
Die Regeln des Spiels sind super einfach und schnell gelernt. Die Miniaturen sind in gewohnter Spitzenqualität von Cool Mini or Not.
Das Spiel macht sehr viel Spaß, da es auch nicht einfache Monster-schlachten ist, sondern nach Mission gespielt wird, ist es auch etwas anspruchsvoller als zum Beispiel Zombicite. Zusätzlich erhält der Overloard nicht einfach nur die Verwaltungsaufgabe sondern hat seine eigene Agenda und sogar faire Chancen selbst zu gewinnen. Es gibt keine Szenarien, die verpflichtend durchgespielt werden. Die Vielfalt und den Wiederspielreiz gewinnt das Spiel durch die verschiedenen Missionen, Monster Typen (Spezialfähigkeit) und Akolythen (1x pro Runde Spezialfähigkeit) die auf verschiedenste Weisen miteinander kombiniert werden können und sich so, rein rechnerisch, eine sehr hohe Anzahl an verschiedenen Spielen ergibt, die im Grundregelwerk gleich bleiben, aber vom Schwierigkeitswert durchaus variieren.
Für mich jetzt schon eines der besten Dungeon Crawler mit Overloard."

This is a well designed game for two players: One is the Sin, one is the Faith team. Despite what it lists on the tin, this is a ""superficial co-op"" game since players on the Faith side have the exact same goal and all information is 100% open.   There's no need and it's in fact worse with more players on the Faith side as a single player will end up controlling every character's actions anyway (they just won't physically move the pieces or roll the dice).  What contributes to this, unlike games like Advanced Heroquest or any RPG, is that there is no carry over between games of The Others, all campaign games are 100% independent of each other.  if you loose your favorite character in the first game, you can use them in any other games."

 As I saw the campaign evolve as it unleashed mini to mini, I was amazed.
 Then the Apocalypse box appeared and my mind was blown. Between the Sins and Team Apocalypse, I've never seen such intricately detailed minis before.
  I missed backing ZBP, but late-pledged it.
 I'm sure in the hell glad I backed this one up. It should deserve a 9 or 10, though it wasn't selected as a KS staff pick compared to Lobotomy, which I also backed (my first KSF). But CMON always delivers."

422,majindelaware,7,"Seems like it has potential, although it does reek slightly of a cash-grab due the absurd amount of expansions attached to it, all of which seem essential to increase the longevity of the game.

Other than that, mechanically it's a bit like Descent meets The Ghostbusters Board Game set in a Clive Barker-esque world that resembles a super-grim Hellboy. Playing as The Sin is pretty fun, I will say, which is nice because one player has to be the bad guy, and depending on the person that can be a bummer in some other games that require that to be the case."

426,mantooth012,8,"A fairly simple game mechanics-wise... though the weight of the rulebook would have you think otherwise. While choices seem limited, they are all critical, and that provides for nice thinking and pressure to do the best thing. The Sins player seems to have plenty of options at his disposal.

I like:
- The minis are great
- Good choices to be made
- Simultaneous combat!! (attacking or being attacked, you are still possibly damaging things!)
- Lots of set up choices to make for variance

Can't wait to play with the other Sins and options!

Just still not sure why they didn't print the map tiles double-sided for more terrain..."

442,mavericklancer,5,"Kickstarter.  Received 9/10/16.

We wanted to like it.  And to some extent, we really do love it.  But it takes way too long for what it is.  Our first play was around 3 hours.  We thought the second would go faster, but even that clocked in at around 2.5 hours.  I played as sin both times, but I can tell my girlfriend was often frustrated at how quickly the sin was able to bounce back.  We had fun both games, but I can see how much of the game is simply lost at only 2 players.  Part of the fun of sin is tempting the FAITH player(s) to take more corruption and to play for themselves rather than the team.  That dynamic and really all of the table talk would really make this a more interesting game, but we likely won't have the time or available gaming friends to support the massive amount of space it takes on the shelf."

It's a fun game and I hope to play it again. It worked well for the collaborative side.

Players take on the roll of a team of agents out to stop the personification of the seven deadly sins from taking over the world, it's a dark mash up of the movies Men in Black and R.I.P.D! Gameplay is simpler than an initial glance might suggest and all of the components are fantastic, but best of all the player playing solo doesn't have to pull any punches, in fact if they do they will probably lose."

456,Mikewill,7,"One versus Many in a horror themed game. Sounds terrible to me, but this game is actually really good. If the player playing the Sin is good then it is very hard for the players to win. We lost our first 3 games, but then won our last 2 that I played (all with different groups). It definitely can suffer from the experienced player telling everyone else what to do, which is exactly what I did on my last play through to get the win.  I won't pick this one up because the theme excludes so many people, but still a great game worth buying for the target audience."

Good, actually very good.  Easy to learn (which is not the norm for an asymmetrical game) and tight.  Several people say Sins have the advantage, but also hear claims that Faith wins as much (my first few games Faith won running) -- but isn't that some evidence of balance?  The more I play the more themes seem to emerge -- you have Hell Boy, Dresden Files (need to make my own heroes for this variant), Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, Hellraiser, Sons of Anarchy, Se7en and just plain old fashion Good vs. Evil . . . to name a few . . .

I like that it's a 1 vs many game but that the 1 doesn't necessarily have a defined turn.  Being able to interrupt a turn or reacting to a previous move really keeps the players in suspense. I also enjoy that the many are facing what appear to be overwhelming odds, yet if they focus on their mission they still have a reasonable chance at winning the game.  "

483,newkillerstar27,5,"This was pretty meh. Looks like another game in the same vein as Zombicide, but ends up being kind of a crazy, cinematic, ""everything is going to hell"" kind of game. In that way, it's pretty unique. You can't take a step without running into a monster, some fire, a pentagram, or cultists. Everything is being destroyed, and the heroes are trying to fight against the Sin Player in a seemingly no-win situation. This is actually pretty accurate, since the Sin Player has a pretty big advantage over the heroes. All they have to do is lie in wait and spring traps on heroes when it's appropriate. I wasn't really sure what to expect with The Others, other than that it looked similar to Zombicide, but I ended up not enjoying it that much. It's difficult to do 1 vs Many games, and the balance in this one seemed a little off."

In this game one person plays the evil overlord against all other players. Interestingly enough, the good characters have very awesome powers and seem to outbalance the overlord. But the overlord is constantly tricking them into using their powers by taking corruption. It's only a matter of time before the good characters become consumed by their own corruption.

The evil powers are the 7 deadly sins like Greed, Wrath, Gluttony, etc. In a given game the overlord chooses his sin of choice for the game and the good players choose their heroes. This is a sandbox type game like say Zombicide, where you set up the game board according to the missions provided or you can make your own setup and special objectives.

Upon playing our first game, the good players are constantly succeeding seemingly easily at every battle or search option. The overlord just gently messes with their plans, giving those heroes a false sense of security. But each round of play the heroes seem to be taking on a mess of corruption and soon perish."

Despite this Kickstarter being incredibly late (not completely CMON's fault), we received not a single piece of correspondence from CMON regarding not filling out a pledge manager on their site (apparently filling this out on the actual Kickstarter page is just an ""informational""). CMON were quite happy for my money to sit in their account indefinitely, making zero effort to contact us about why they were not sending anything out to us. 
On contacting them, nothing but disdain from their support personnel - the fault was mine for not reading all 63 updates on the Kickstarter page and noticing I hadn't received an email they didn't send me. They wanted extra money to mail a new copy of whatever they had in stock from the USA - at considerable cost and paying all import costs.
For such an ""established"" company, I find their attitude astounding and I will never deal with this sham of a company again."

571,Ruud2009,8,"03-11-2016. Rated after 1 play. The Others: 7 Sins is yet another new game from Eric M. Lang. So far, I have enjoyed many of his recent games. It seems to me that the Others: 7 Sins is the next one in a line of successes.

The theme of the Others: 7 Sins is dark. A group of people fights the corruption of a semi-biblical end-time inspired set of sins. The game resolves around players activating heroes in order to obtain specific scenario-based objectives. In response to hero activation, the overlord may activate his own troops to try to kill them. Fun twist here is that the Heroes can be corrupted by the sins, and grow in power sacrificing/harming themselves in order to do so.

SO far, I played several games wrong but the mechanisms and the gameplay appealed to me. I wonder if we can get the next game to be a more tense exercise."

573,rytrepanier,9,"What's to say about this - easily one of my favourite games, this is such an immersive experience and is paired with streamlined rules that never get in the way of the theme or the action. I detest tactical minis games that bog down - this avoids that problem with a ruleset that is perfectly functional and does not simplify the game to a point where you don't feel decisions matter. Everything still matters, and yet the rules are never going to be a thing to slow the gameplay of this one down. I'm waiting for this one to get old, but it hasn't in half a dozen plays."

583,ScaperDeage,6,"After trying the game several times, I've found that it just doesn't click for me. I think my biggest issue is how the Sin player does their actions. The constant interruptions in the turn order started to get on my nerves very quickly. Makes it feel like it is impossible to coordinate with my allies when it comes to positioning. Want to stay together for a dice buff in combat? Well too bad cuz the Sin player will likely attack the lone player before the next one can move their character. I'm not sure I can get over my dislike of this part of the game, which is a big disappointment for me since I adore the theme."

Ratings obviously subject to change as game is tried more and more"
638,StormKnight,6,"A lot of mixed feelings here.
The base mechanics are good. The game plays at a decent pace and isn't too complicated. Heroes have an interesting set of abilities, and a lot of tense choices. The action is exciting.
However, a lot of strengths of the Sin player feel ""cheap"". Heroes take damage just by walking around. The Sins get to teleport in monsters in a variety of ways. A lucky roll by the heroes probably doesn't make much difference, but a lucky roll by the Sins devastates the heroes.
I'm never a fan of 1 vs. all games, and this is no exception.
There are a few areas where balance feels off:
* Things seem much easier for the Sin player.
* Shooters seem very weak.
* Clumps of several monsters are really tough for the heroes to do anything about, and very easy for the Sin player to make.

Overall I like it, but I think I may want to make some houserules to deal with some of these issues.

Also, 7 different sin model sets seems like a complete waste; since you never use more than 1 set at a time anyway, and they aren't recognizable in any sense, there might as well just be one generic set.

So from a sin player's point of view, this game is awesome. It takes long in my circle, last night's story took nearly 5 hours (4 heroes controlled by two figures), but I have had AP issues in my circle for every game. 

I love it, but another player from my group claims he would never be able to play the lone sin. So unless your group has that one person who is willing to, or even wants to play as the lone antagonist, you might want to reconsider it."

I don't feel like i purposely screw over the faith players, i play what is in my hand and guide them a little if they need it. For instance i pointed out a few times in the last session what people could do and mentioned i may or may not have things to play. In the end, it came down to two dice rolls. Really engaging on the edge of your seat action. Every time we play it is an epic experience!"

686,Turin14,9,"This game is beautiful.  I really enjoy this type of horror theme.  Love the artwork, the miniatures are excellent, and I don't think I have seen any other game with this level of detail put into every piece.  (Really, any of these abominations and avatars could rival Games Workshop's Chaos Daemons, and these came pre-assembled and of a sturdier, more flexible and weighty plastic).  On aesthetics alone, opening this box made me excited to play!

So far, I have played it with 5 as the Sins player, which was very fun, and with 2 as the FAITH player (team of 3 heroes), which was more of a strategic back and forth type play.  I would agree with the community in this game being best with 3 or 5 players, as 4 FAITH team members is ideal, and the table talk between the co-op team really changes the game play environment. 
 
First Impressions are that there are a lot of rules, but once you learn them all, they all make sense and are easy to remember.  I suspect game play will be much smoother when playing again with the same group.  I think the game itself is very exciting and strategic, and the rules themselves make the Sin player terrifying to the FAITH team and adds a lot of tension and anxiety as everyone carefully plans their strategies to complete their goals, while the Sins player does his best to exploit any mistakes or weaknesses in their plans!

I am excited to play again, and feel like every time we do it will be a unique experience.  With the core box alone, there are 28 different scenarios to play!  (7 Stories, with 2 Maps for each, and 2 different Sins to be used for each of them.)  Add the other 5 Sins from expansions, and that brings you to 98!  Not to mention the FAITH Team Expansions add more city tiles and new maps for each of the 7 Stories to go along with them, as well as giving you 6 different teams to choose from, and a total of 35 unique characters to build your own FAITH team.  There is also the big box expansion Apocalypse, which adds a new game mode, an 8th Story board and 6 maps to go with it.  That makes 8 Stories x 6 Maps each x 7 Sins = 336 unique scenarios to play through, with your choice of 7 from 35 unique characters.  I can't fathom playing though anywhere near that many games, so that puts the replay-ability of this game at virtually infinite!

I should also mention that I believe you could create a very intense campaign by following each of the 8 stories in order, using a different Sin for each, culminating in the Apocalypse!  FAITH could build a team from their pool of 35 characters, permanently removing from the campaign any characters who die in each story!

Very impressed with this game.  Would definitely recommend!"

689,TyDeL,8,"Definitely need and want to play more often.  Game is far more abstract feeling than I originally thought.  The map is sort of misleading as you think it's going to be a dungeon crawl, it's much more gamerly than that as you can jump around the map pretty easily.  You really do need to plan out your objectives and what everyone's goal is going to be each round, meanwhile the Sin player is constantly throwing wrenches in those plans.

Really neat and interesting... the dice rolls can be a bit frustrating.  I love exploding dice, and I love the randomness added to a light and fun game like Arcadia Quest... they're a little less welcome here when you're already balancing on a knife edge."

The Others has fantastic atmosphere of postapocalyptic world invaded by sins. In my opinion scenarios are balanced, but I'm playing only in couple, so i don't know how is it working with more players. The game is not so easy to learn, but the rulebook is good written. Everytime when we are playing, there are huge emotions, because the situation on the map is unstable and we need to think all the time. There is the real feeling of saving the world or destroying it.

Positive Final Thoughts –

I have had a great time playing this game. I’ve tried out both of the Sins twice each and played as all the heroes and each one offers up a unique experience. The gameplay is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand as it’s mostly based on the board state rather than having a million actions to remember. The theme is interesting and the game does have a number of expansions already released to further enhance your gameplay if you so choose. Overall as far as 1 vs many style games go I think this one is at least on par with Fury of Dracula for me for being my favorite 1 vs many game. It’s got more variability and replayability options than Fury does but I prefer the board and powers that Dracula offers. 


Negative Final Thoughts –

My biggest gripe are the board tiles lack of theme considering the game is based on a demon invasion. They just look like standard city tiles with a couple tiny indications of demon graffiti like a corruption icon spray painted on the wall. The storage solution is a little wonky as well with the huge mini holder boxes within a box and trying to fit all the tokens in there. More dice would have been nice as well although this isn’t a game breaker by any means."
720,wohomerhoo,8.25,"This may go higher as I play it more.  I really like the action.  Even though I play the Sins, I enjoy watching the heroes plan.  If you are impatient as the DM, you might pass.  There can be a lot of downtime between your turns.  (8-10 Hero turns vs 2-3 Sin turns)"
721,Wolfshade,2,"This one fell flat for me.
I didn't see interesting choices, character death I don't mind per se. However *knowing* you will have to go through several characters removes any ""connection"" with the character you are playing.
So if I'm in the mood for this kind of game I'd much rather play Arkham Horror, Zombicide or Lobotomy."

Everything on the board feels quite strong, but there are smart rules for keeping the playing field fair (e.g. monsters can't ever leave spaces with heroes; heroes can leave spaces with monsters but have to take 1 mandatory wound). Things are constantly dying on the board, but then coming back. While it's certainly a game that pits two sides against each other, since both sides are expecting casualties, the deaths don't really hit too hard. Even when heroes die, they've done some things along the way to push towards the missions (and the hero that replaces them gets to keep the same number of gear cards as their predecessor). There are also some strong differences in the Others that set it apart from other dungeon crawlers and 1-vs-All games I've played before (e.g. city actions; Sins player reacts to hero turns as their own turns; ramping tension with Apocalypse track).

The exploding dice seems a little weighted toward sin though.  An especially bad run against fire can really harm the heroes.  Lots of variability and strategy here."

I think it would have been better if it was like Hero Quest, where ALL the heroes take their turn and THEN the monsters take their turn. Having the monsters move at any time (despite having a limited number of moves), made it so that they could just pick off the first hero who moved and was vulnerable, which left heroes with very limited options and was not fun."

742,zenmazster,7,"Mini first impression review:

Played one game tonight, I was Pride, played a 2 player game.

Other player had no problem playing all characters, in fact I think he preferred it that way.

Art was amazing, minis were off the charts amazing, every bit as good as blood rage.

Game play reminded me very much of zombicide at first, which I thought was an ok game.  As the game progresses, characters got better and beefed up which seemed natural and fun.  My power got better as well through a pretty cool system.  

The hero player definitely got to make more meaningful choices to try and stay alive and manage win condition.  I always like playing the bad guy, and my guys were ultra powerful, but all I did really was go around bashing skulls in.  Was fun but not as strategic, although I can see the potential for greater strategy with more complicated story objectives.

Good guy ultimately won, but it was very close.  I killed the hero in the final battle and they only had one left, so very close and tense.

The thurs act of the game was definitely more fun than the first act, so once the carnage ramps up it gets much better.

Overall very fun, looking forward to the epic amount of content I got.  The first scenerio was pretty fun .But mostly introduced me to core mechanics.

The art and minis blew me away, the game play was great but not Blood rage amazing (hard trick to top Eric, hard to top perfection).  But I think all desigN goals were met, and it's a game cmon should be vet proud of, and won I'm glad I own.  I think it can only get better with t be new stories we play, not to mention apocalypse content."

Heroes must then clean up tokens with bad effects. Both players can pin each others miniatures and that makes for a tactical display of choices. The game gets a more puzzling aspect because of this. Game can be very hard and punishing for the non-Sin players. "

Bisher habe ich nur die Helden gespielt, aber das macht richtig Laune! Außerdem ein Pluspunkt: Variabler Aufbau, so dass sich das selbe Szenario auf verschiedene Weise spielen lässt."
