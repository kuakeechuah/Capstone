Not sure if I want to try a harder boss if this is how it plays with just Red Mist."

10,bigoi75,8,"I've played it solo (twice) and in 3 player count and it work well!
First play was a little bit slow and confusing since there are lot of things to keep in mind BUT already on second play I start to enjoy this game. With bigger player count difficulties raise up but working in team you can afford this.
Dice results must enter, so there is lucky (also with card draft for object, events, villains etc.) but you also have tacticts to play and you never feel frustrated.
It's a long game (60-90 is not real ... just consider at least 45min/player) and some being a cooperative is necessary to have a good grooup, but if you like the comic (and even if not) justget this game a chance.
Played only first scenario (Red Mist) until now. I'll tray asap the other ones."
11,Bitpicker,6,While I was able to win the game once in solo mode with a single hero I get the impression the game scales to get MUCH harder with each further player. If you find it too hard to win with more than a single character you can scale it down a bit by using the spawn bars and / or event cards for fewer players.

15,cmmayo,6,"I got this game because I was a fan of the comic going back 10 years. I'm pleasantly surprised by the fairly straightforward solo play--you can play as one character, or what some solo purists might call ""true solo."" There is a large amount of text to keep track of between your player mat, items, event cards, board locations, spawn cards, etc. It came together in my second play. The designers did a good job bringing the elements of the comics into the game and there are plenty of tough decisions that crop up during play to make it a challenge. Bottom line, I had fun.

18,DrWorm331,7,"Difficult co-op game with action cards to define actions and only 9 city locations, Plays quickly and has a fair amount of variability with the largish event deck and 5 Villains that completely change the final act. Variability would have been great if the hero's had more differences. I didn't have any vigilante / hero games and this makes a great addition to my collection. Components are CMON standard, Great!

A missed opportunity that characters unique ability (famous activation card) is difficult to unlock. Perhaps characters should have also had a starting ability to make them more unique."

29,Gurneywars,6,"Where to begin?  I guess i'll start with the game.  It is just another basic cooperative game.  Pretty much all of them work about the same with some changes in themes, skins or abilities.  You either work as a team or you get that one guy or gal who basically tells you how you have to play to win.  If you like the Kick ass theme and co op game then this is your game.

As far as components pretty basic.  the miniatures arn't to bad and the card stock is pretty good.  There are 3 different sizes of cards.  i just don't understand why companies feel they need to do that?  I found the insert to be stupid though.  First they did fit the miniatures in pretty well but it looks like there is 2 levels but it is just the way the insert is.  Which with all that wasted room they could have come up with a better way for the cards and other components to be stored.  The cards will not fit in insert with sleeves in any way.  2 sets of cards actually use the box as edges of there holder.  The punch out counters have extra bags you can put them in but absolutely no where in the insert to put them.  After making the punch out there is extra space in box and the cards will fly loose if you tip the box.

Is it worth the MSRP.  Absolutely not.  If you can get it for 20-25 bucks then yeah not a bad deal.  Especially when you need to find a better insert or make one."

Classic CMON dice heavy game—Based on what I’ve read I’d maybe buy it, after playing, for the theme for solo play, but I’m not that huge of a fan of the IP or punishing games that depend on dice for combat.

63,pickboy87,2,"Minis for the sake of minis, clunky rules, and the game pace felt off. I lost interest pretty quickly before the game ended. The dice mechanic feels dated."
64,Pol56,6.5,"The good :
The deck building is very good, subtle but fun upgrades, with very nice theme. ( you want to do volunteer work? Gives good publicity, increases you well being but cuts down on your free time)
The scenarios keep the game moving without overly forcing the play. 

The bad : 
Characters can max out a little too easy. It's more fun when the ultimate is (just)  too difficult. 

The ugly : 
Well, it's not ugly, just really bad. This game takes way too long. 

For you information, we play the first scenario with 4 players. It was quite easy but it took over 3 hours. ."

66,punkin312,7.5,"Super challenging cooperative game! Really hard to manage all of the baddies that show up, you really need to get into a groove quickly to manage it all. Love the challenge! Really cool looking game too. Really enjoyed this an looking forward to playing more."
67,Quillbone,8,"Kick-Ass is a fun and multi-faceted strategy board game. It combines elements of worker placement, deck building and dice stacking mechanics to create a layered and challenging gaming experience for players. Contend with enemy spawning cards as well as an impending event deck to keep New York City safe from criminals and villainous plots, while also trying to balance your stats (social media likes, happiness, health and money). 

Thematically it works beautifully. The excellently sculpted miniatures, beautiful board, character dashboards and the artwork from John Romita Jr (Kick-Ass Co Creator and Artist); which appears on all of the cards and even in the rulebook, all add to the player experience and really bring the world of Kick-Ass right to your tabletop. 

The biggest criticism I've seen this game receive is also one of its greatest strengths. It's difficult. It is is by no means a walk in Central Park. Having to balance all of the different elements of your own character and still make time to move throughout the city to bust crimes is by no means an easy task. And nor should it be. This was the very essence of Kick-Ass' struggle in the comics, and it's only right that this struggle be reflected in the mechanics of the board game. Kick-Ass gets his ass kicked more often than not, and even when he wins, victory has its price. This too, is true for any brave enough to immerse themselves in this board game.

I'm a sucker for a game with nice miniatures, so when the mechanics and gameplay are immersive, layered and challenging, it is an absolute pleasure to have such a game on my tabletop.

Pros:
-Nice miniatures
-Nice board
-Well boxed
-Great artwork
-Layered mechanics
-Solid strategy game
-1 player
-Very thematic in gameplay
-Event Decks offer diverse challenges
-Final Plot Decks are individualised and offer unique special rules which keeps players on their toes

Cons (and ways around them):
-Dice: rolling for success is not easy. 
Solutions: 
--Strategically you can overcome this by acquiring the katana and night vision item cards in the shop district of the game board and/or get your character activation cards like 'Sadistic' or 'High Cost, High Reward' to assist your ass-kicking.
OR
--House Rules: using D6 instead of the red assault dice with the following values 
1-2: Miss
3: Lightning
4-5: Hit
6: Hit & Lightning
This way your chances of missing are reduced when you acquire a weapon with the lightning ability, but also a 6 then offers a double hit.

Overall, I'm a big fan of this game. It can be frustratingly difficult, but if it were too easy, that'd be worse. Even after a very tricky 1-player game in which Big Daddy got mowed down by a hail of bullets from the Skull Gang and Vic Gigante, in my final activation of Round 9... I was disappointed, I was gutted, I was mourning the loss of a great hero... but I was invigorated to try that mission again. 

My head was spinning with decisions I'd made which had hampered my chances of victory. From spending too much money on mediocre items, to picking up activation cards I never got to see the benefit from and to not keeping enough districts clear, there were a range of decisions I could have made differently to tip the balance of the game. In that way, it makes the game fresh each time you put it out on the table. A lot of the event cards will pop up again after 2 or 3 games, but how you and your chosen heroes choose to engage with the villainy of New York City, is entirely up to you."
