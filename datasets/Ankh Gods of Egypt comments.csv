11,Arah,9.8,"[b]Ankh Micro Review:[/b]
I have always had admiration for abstracts like Go that have a lot of depth with just a few, elegant rules. I have also always appreciated the mechanisms of euro games that create interesting decision making. I have always liked area control games. But abstracts and euros have always been dry, and thematic games have almost always been shallow. Could one game possibly integrate them all?

Lang has outdone himself and gives us Ankh: a hybrid, competitive multiplayer area control game for 2-5 players that has the best of all worlds: euro-quality mechanics, abstract area control (A mixture of Chess' piece movement and Go's multitasking), impressive miniatures and featuring high direct and indirect conflict.

[b]Why I love it?[/b]
-Design: It is very hard to make a competitive game that is excellent at 2 and 3 players. So, as much as I enjoy playing the game and being immersed in all that interesting decision making and strategy, I am also equally impressed by the depth and subtleties that the design allows.
-Excellent hybrid: While it retains the important qualities of ameri/war area control games (miniatures and high territorial conflict), it also integrates seamlessly both euro and abstract qualities in an elegant manner. You get the joy of high conflict area control, juicy euro mechanisms and abstract depth all in one regular length session.
-Depth: It has as much high quality indirect conflict as direct, with tactical and strategic importance. The way everything integrates adds an unprecedented amount of depth and subtlety.
-Skill matters: This game rewards a lot of skill and removes a lot of things that usually get in the way of that. Every decision matters and every move makes sense. It is clear that winners outplayed the losers and, in retrospect, which moves were game-winning and which were mistakes.
-More than replayability: This game offers a novel experience every game. Replayability and asymmetry are not just throwing together a mindless salad, but they are features of mixing a few high impact elements that affect short and long term strategy as well as dynamically evolving during the game due to player's decisions.

[b]Why it may not be for you?[/b]
-More brain burn than theme: Yes, there are many powerful thematic mechanisms and splendid miniatures, but it is closer to Spirit Island, where the game is best enjoyed at its crunchy and deep gameplay rather than for theme.
-There are 2 potential group dependent factors may get in the way:
*Doesn't hold your hand: The first game will be cognitively overwhelming, and experience may be an advantage for the first few games. Then, skill dominates. Let me tell you that people are not used to games where the best player wins, plain and simple. Many games allow all players a fair chance, this one will punish you for mistakes.
*Balance is in the eye of the beholder: Perception of how strong one isolated element is may also be an issue with newbies. Low skill players may not be able to figure out a way to outplay a seemingly strong element. Examples: Denying someone of event triggering (it 'feels' bad, but 2 actions are sometimes better), the monster Satet (it can move even gods to other regions but only if the player allows it by placing their god in a frontier hex) and the god Set (takes control of adjacent units, so you cluster and corner your units).

[b]Player Scaling:[/b]
The fact that the number of players will scale down means it plays well at the lower player counts, 2 and 3 players, where it feels extremely strategic. At 4 and 5 players, the game feels more chaotic, but you also get areas chock full of units and combat so it is more ameritrash/thematic. Game length with 4-5 new players can be long. The higher complexity of the game state can induce AP. Maybe scale at 3/4/5 spaces away for short/medium/long as another option for a 'blitz' scenario.

***[i]No design or major balance flaws detected in one day. World's first (for modern board games).[/i]***

[b]Favorite element:[/b]
Each of the gods takes the center stage. My personal favorites are: Amun Ra (what a coincidence), Osiris, Horus, Hathor, Set, Sobek and Thoth. So almost all of them!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Longer Description:[/b]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Euro-Quality Mechanics:[/b]
-Ankh tackles both runaway leaders and kingmaking with a genius player fusion mechanisms inside the Devotion scoring track: The two lowest players will fuse into one in the late game, gaining double turns. Also, underperforming players will get eliminated before the end, even [b]all[/b] players can lose! And, to prevent dragging, anyone reaching the top immediately ends the game.
-Multiple track action selection mechanism: Players move along many tracks, with the last spot in each advancing the event track in their favor. This is the track that will dictate the pacing of the game and trigger the combat phases.
-Skill tree tableau: You can unlock two skills and one monster per level. If you are too late, the monster pool empties.

[b]Abstract area control:[/b]
-The lean rules overhead also contributes to this 'abstract' vibe.
-The map is divided by divisible regions, and regions by hexes. Hexes can be water, grass or desert and can hold one figure or monument.
-Monuments are of 3 types and tend to outlast units, but are immobile and vulnerable to capture.
-Units can move to other regions, but adjacency is inside a region only and units die a lot. Adjacency is key to capture monuments or gain followers (resources).
-Units exerrt direct control and engage in direct combat, while monuments exert indirect control and engage in majority and control indirect conflict.

[b]Ameritrash Asymmetry:[/b]
-Players will battle in regions with cards reminiscent of Concordia's hand management, but with BR/RS effects.
-Each player plays an unkillable god with unique and powerful abilities, like capturing defeated units. Each also has a tableau with a skill tree that further differentiates players.
-Monsters are also highly asymmetric and impactful.

[b]Replayability:[/b]
Enormous amount of replayability, given by:
-Setup variance: gods in play (and not in play), the 3 guardians (and those not in play), turn order and the scenario that dictates the setup and maybe an additional rule.
-Evolving Asymmetry: Despite only starting with different god powers and positions, each game goes in radically different ways as the game state fluctuates massively.
-Efficient and effective, high impact of each of the setup elements. Each setup element feels like a module in impact, yet achieved with only 1 figure.

[b]Compared to Blood Rage and Rising Sun:[/b]
Despite having easier rules and having less moving parts, it is way harder to play to a competent degree. It feels a bit more euro, but more importantly, and what sets it apart from other area control games, it feels more abstract. While the theme is there, integrated with mechanisms and the impressive minatures, it does feel a bit less thematically immersive than the other two games. This is because you will be immersed in the beautiful mechanisms and gameplay."

The KS campaign for this game is currently running and it has 93 ratings on bgg: Mostly by people who love/hate CMON or Lang('s area control games) - hardly anyone who even touched the components. 
If you're reading this, be not like those ********* (actually random number of *s - didn't want ot get to vulgar)! Play a game before you rank it (preferably more than once - depending on its length and content). Take your time - if the review takes you less then a few minutes, you're either a genius beyond compare, or gave it neither thought nor effort. 
Explain your score, what you (dis-)liked and the context in which you judge the game, all so to make it your contribution to the hobby.
Show your understanding for the merit of statistics and honest reviews (unlike the fanboys/haters mentioned above): Give exactly the score you feel the game has! 
If you give honest and intricate reviews, know that you have my gratitude and I hope you keep participating and contributing to the hobby - and if not, remember that the few seconds it took you to leave your ""rating"" were wasted in the best case and at worst a detriment to the hobby you spend your time with."

42,ChimBlade,6.8,"DISCLAIMER: Played one game on TTS. My opinions are also usually bad.

Ankh was good, but nothing particularly special. I'd rather play Rising Sun if I'm looking for that kind of experience. Some neat ideas that ultimately felt a little too limiting for my tastes. A strange mix of euro-style action selection in a game like this doesn't feel right for some reason. Perhaps it is my fault for thinking of it as a high conflict area control game, but the main mechanism by which you take actions feels incredibly off to me. The caravans which split up regions on the map were cool as was the merging of gods. It is not something I'm particularly eager to return to, although I will give it a second shot at some point.

How does it compare to the other 2 games? I'm not personally a fan of Blood Rage (drafting isn't my favorite thing in the world... unless its 2 player drafting). I LOVE Rising Sun though. The game is definitely drier than both and the decisions are less interesting, in my opinion. 

I actually think the action board suffers from what I think drafting suffers from at higher player counts: its a mechanic that pretends to give you influence over other players' actions/options when it really doesn't (or gives you VERY minimal influence). In a Blood Rage style draft, it doesn't really matter what cards you don't take because when there are 3 other people around the table, you have literally no idea who is going to take the card you leave in your hand. So, it's usually not even worth considering what cards you leave. Of course, there will be some obvious choices that you may take to block other players, but even then seeing the cards doesn't help you know where they went. In a 2 player draft, this problem is resolved, and I love 2 player drafts (Inis is best at 2, for example). The action board here suffers from a similar problem, I think. It looks like you have control over the board and can influence what actions others take or try to manipulate the board to the state you want, but it's essentially random after 3-4 other people mess with it.

The game went for a little over 2 hours (teach excluded). I think this number will be closer to 90 minutes after another play or two, but I was expecting it to be shorter for sure."
43,christhomas226,9,"Played the TTS, really enjoyed it at 4. I think people's issue with some players may not have guardians is a non-issue. I won without guardians i started off 4th but managed to get 2nd before merger and still won. The game is punishing though if players make bad plays, but the game has a lot of depth."
44,Crikrunner,7,"Played on TTS i like the parts of Mexica, Chicago Express, and Kemet it has in it.  Wish it had more asymmetry.  Player 4 felt hosed from the get go being an action behind and missing out on events.  Will play more before I back."

If you don't have the most followers by the time first conflict rolls around, your opponent will kill your figures with a plague and you spend the rest of the game both behind in area majority and followers while your opponent just picks when and where he will kill your figures again using plague since less figures on the board means less followers to prevent it.

The map/hexes hadn't enough impact IMHO, but the battles were pretty enjoyable. The merged gods mechanism is interesting but not fun at all. Much better with 4 players. Not worth it with 3 because of the two capitals. They felt weird and out of place. Maybe better with another scenario. 2P seems to be boring. Chess? Come on... No way.

145,nickbudz,4,"I am bummed out that I won't get to complete the trilogy, but this one just isn’t going to work for my group.  The action selection is a lot of fun, and the beginnings of the game are enjoyable, but everything post-merge has proven to be really unsatisfying.

In the games I've played, the merged gods were far enough behind that they barely  had enough time to avoid getting eliminated, by which time the lead player was in the process of ending the game anyways.  If everyone was close on the point track it might be a different story, but the lowest person on the track is still going to lose all of their powers, monuments, and units (in other words, everything they've worked for the entire game).

I like the game enough, but not so much that I want it competing with already established favorites for our limited gaming time.  Thank goodness for TTS — saved me a lot of money!"

oddly restrictive
retail version not recommendable

Currently it seems that ""Blood Rage"" remains by far the best of the series.
Blood Rage >> Ankh > Rising Sun


From what I've seen so far, I don't like a lot of the miniatures. Although they have elaborate details they look neither beautiful nor cool. Some don't look good at all (e.g. the Apep crocodile, Babi, Griffin, ...), some are very odd and disturbing (zombie cats, Pazuzu, Taweret, ...). 
The best looking miniatures in the game are the normal warriors (and some of the priests). Best guardian miniature without real comeptition is Unut.

+ Egyptian mythology theme, playing as gods and winning as mono deity
+ deeper than it looks, shifting strategies: players have to adapt to what their opponents do, mind games ?
- oddly restrictive
-- balancing issues, runaway leader problem ?
- unfortunate choices in the design of the miniatures*
- Camels as border markers is just plain ridiculous.
-- Kickstarter exclusive game content -> punishes retail buyers
- only cardboard monuments in retail version
- extremely expensive

* There are some unfortunate choices in the design of the miniatures (camels as borders, Apep miniature, Thoth as ape, Bastet warriors wearing feline fleeces, exclusive monument miniatures not in sand color, pyramids too small?, Pazuzu, ...).

The merging of gods is basically a forced alliance. Not that innovative. But it's cool that it's tied in with the Egyptian theme.
The combinations of guardians to play with and of god powers to unlock are quite restricted. It seems there is a lot potential left out. But when you are lucky enough to have the KS exclusive guardians you can try to play with more diversity by house rule.


issues I currently see in the game:
- which players get to trigger the events seems more or less random
- fixed number of conflicts and monument control events, not much opportunity to outdo opponents in specific fields
- interlocked power unlocking and guardian recruitment
- limited number of guardian figures per type, not every player can get one, and especially when behind on level 1 it's harder to catch up for the next levels
- merging gods overpowered in case of close devotion state at time of merge (all players might need to work to avoid this game state, like with the Loki strategy in ""Blood Rage"")
- only one type of guardian per level per game, the fact that they are divided in levels limits diversity severely, also more than one figure of same guardian is odd
- every player has only 6 combat cards, all have the same, only two give power bonus, I wonder if a 7th card with +1 power and no ability would have been a good addition
- hard to interact with a strong board position, most of the time it's hard to take away monuments from opponents
- guardians not enough impact and come into play to late

213,wallnip,6,"played on TTS. see updates below.

Gameplay depth seems mediocre. i dont feel like there were a lot of deep decisions which had me enter AP mode. If there was, it was usually when i had to decide if i wanted to activate an event or give it up. most of the times, i dont have much control in deciding the state of the action board.
Asymmetry was pretty ok but i felt some god's power were far better, for example, those who's abilities gave battle modifiers. Ankh is eventually an area control game, not a resource conversion set collection game. stocking up on followers wont win you the game. But strength, strength modifiers, battle modifiers will win you territories and eventually net you devotion. 

Moving on to guardians, there are a lot of similarities between Ankh's guardians to RS's monsters. most of them are like demi-gods with 1 strength (usually) with ability imbued. But there is much more balance here in Ankh. everyone in ankh gets a maximum of 4 guardians, unlike RS where usually 1 or 2 players (esp the bonsai clan) will horde monsters to stack its abilities. Guardians have abilities that do not overlap or 'stack' unlike RS, making them seem not so overpowered, and the core focus is still on the Gods and warriors placement.

i like the guardians in Ankh, but, like RS, not all will be available for choosing during the game, and hence, i don't see the need to get the guardian add-ons. adds variety, but the real core focus isnt them.

As for the action selection board, i feel that some players (at higher player count) will never see themselves being able to activate the events, which sucks big time. this reminds me of RS's mandate cards where sometimes you will never be able to use certain mandate cards, and in this case, an event. And these events / mandate cards are a major part of dominance in an area control. not being able to do any really impacts the game a lot. The action selection board really does well at lower player count, but not with 5. however, this leads to my next point.

And now the most contentious point: the merged god mechanics. this is a love hate thing. this makes ankh only playable at 4p or 5p. let me explain, at 3p, its eventually a 2p game late game, somewhat heading to the notion of bashing the leader? The leading player will just feel like he's being ganged up by the other 2 players. imagine a 2p area control game, not fun at all. not to mention that the merge god takes double the actions too. at 4p and 5p, at least there is still a choice of conflict between 2/3 other players. it is more fun with more decisions to be made. however, also with 5p, players may never be able to activate the events in the action selection board.

the merged gods mechanics is pretty imba actually. it is a VERY strong catch up mechanics. i can see why most people will argue that most games see the merged gods win, and other who didnt, i guess the leading player must have been really far up on the devotion track. with that sentence, i guess you will realise that the merged  gods can earn a hell lot of points in 1 turn/battle. it is almost like an exponential burst of points. it is fun to be the merged god though. 
personally, i like it. its new. its fresh. for now.... 

battle cards.... rising sun battle was so much more interesting. i loved that. but for Ankh battles are really quite boring and straightforward. 

For a 100usd cost, i think Ankh base game is too expensive. the plastic is fomo-worthy, but most of them add no value to deepen the gameplay. with 1 play, i feel like i may have explored all that Ankh had to offer in terms of its mechanics. i'd only pay 100usd if the god pantheon and priest expansions are added in. 

Score: 7. i think i may like this more than RS. but i need more plays. it could eventually be like RS, where i dislike it the more i play it.

Update after 2nd play: 7 > 6. Yes, Ankh is starting to be like RS. i am disliking it the more i play at player counts that isnt 4. mandate cards in RS are like events in Ankh, having little to no opportunity of getting the one you need gives a sense of helplessness. 

2nd update after more plays: I cant help but keep comparing this to RS. BR is the best of the trilogy. For Ankh, 
- Battles are not exciting as compared to RS or even kemet
+ There is also a stronger feeling of me being able to control areas i desire via movement which i felt was something that RS didnt have. 
- Ankh powers for each god seems to have a fixed build with little deviation if i want to maximise that God's power. This makes playing the same god feel samey over time. The few chances of deviation would be due to other player's actions. 
+ (the only) exciting part of the game is in the action board just like RS with the mandate cards.
- strictly 4p only. i wont play at any other player count. 
+ inability to turtle and amass troops is good, but this makes certain conflict-focused god powers far more powerful than others
- did i mention this is too expensive? no? this game is way too expensive for what it offers. good job milking cmon. u disgust me just like the time machine crap you pulled. eric lang is wonderful however.
>i do want to drop this score to a 5 but for now, it'll remain as 6

summary: 
+ the dual god catch up mechanics. 
+ i like how choosing your ankh abilities can affect the choice of strategy in playing the whole game

+/- i like the action selection mechanics, and it works best at 3p. but bcos of the merged god mechanics, it should be played at 4p minimally... so... omg. this game is really not done properly! 
+/- feel like there is not much control for an area control game. akin to rising sun's mandate cards. But at least in ankh there is no luck involved. 
+/- each game's warrior/god placement is based on a scenario book. it seems fixed, and i feel like this fixes the way on how players will make their opening move. i dont know, but i never liked games where starting pieces are fixed. it offers little room for variability. but i'll give the benefit of the doubt and have this in the neutral section.

- some god's power is better than others
- some guardian's power is better than others
- this game awards players who stick to the same strategy cos if you change them halfway, the ankh abilities you choose might become less useful 
- i think the battle cards are not interesting. usually there's always just that 1 or 2 cards you'd play (drought, build monument, miracle). the rest are really..... meh. And can probably guess what the opponent will do. Like rising sun's mandate cards.
- after the gods merge, i kinda felt like almost everything in the game is mildly predetermined."
214,Warnuckel37,10,"Played on TTS, great euro style game by Mr. Lang and the final part of the trilogy. The actual game will feel better on your table. Really like the mechanics, the look and its at least the level of RS / BR but different enough to add it to your collection. As said it feels more euro ,style for me. Tasts are different, some dont like the minis, for me most of them are great. And now  ...... get it you sand flea"
