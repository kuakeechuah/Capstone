9,DaHunterz007,9,"As I get deeper into the games mechanics, work out some of the more vague rule set, i realise CMON have finally delivered a game that becomes more addictive with each play and isn't just pretty to look at.

Seriously, fun, fast and addictive and to top it off, some seriously epic miniatures that surpass the last few Arcadia Quest Series for me. 

The only problem i see, as with any other munchkin  game, this is competitive and boy can you be cruel to win. 

Piling up those Dungeon Threat tokens takes on a whole new feel to kicking down the door and looting. It makes you think twice before running ahead, because the more you do, the more tokens all the other players have to mess with you when you decide to finally stop. 

We played our first game with 5 players, while we didn't get a lot of the rules correct, it was too much and the wait time for your turn again, was too far apart. It can be played 2-5 but i highly recommend 2-3, 4 at the very most. But if you have time I guess 5 can be ok. Just be prepared to have a slow and painful race the end of the 20 Fame Track.

I am still on the fence with my copy of Starcadia Quest. But with Munchkin Dungeon, i know it's coming to the table at least once every few weeks now. I just wish they had more bosses, which i guess comes with the ridiculously priced expansions that will eventually come to retail such as Cthulu."

16,fa1ataka,9,"I don't understand others giving 1, 2 or 3 without playing it, just because it's CMON or they find it expensive. This game is a party game, quick, cruel and fun. It focuses in two major mechanic, you need to push your luck and decide if you go deeper or not after each room cleared. Also there is a self-balancing mechanic on the top of this: the deeper you go, the more threat token you produce for the others. And they'll use them to play cards against you. Really, really fun if you find a good group for it, don't expect an arcadia/zombicide ... whatver game, it's totally different, entry level fun game.
And yes, maybe overproduced, but hey, it's beautiful, if you can afford it. Just don't rate it because of the price, that's quite unfair, as a party game it works pretty well."

23,Green Angel,8,"If you can get past the badly written rules (most things can be figured out with a little common sense) it is fun and not too long (unlike the card game). Definately a better GAME than the other Munchkin games. A little overproduced though (normal for CMON), eg you don't actually need the HUGE boss miniatures in actual play."
24,HailTheSun,3,"Cmon certainly has an interesting business model. Slapping tons of minis on the same ruleset that has been used a million times in their other games like Zombicide and Arcadia Quest and selling it as a new game for a high price tag. Somehow the fact that they print Eric Lang's name on the box makes most people ignore the fact that they are selling the same game over and over again. Munchkin Dungeon takes most of its mechanics from Arcadia Quest with the exception of character sheets that are taken from Zombicide. But hey, Eric Lang gave his name for it so it must be spectacular right?"

26,Jeff321,5,"I've demoed this.  It's better than Munchkin (which I dislike), but still just ok.  I'd much rather play Arcadia Quest.  The freedom of movement on the board is very limited.  It's still a take-that card game at its core.  Deck draws can make-or-break you with no way to cycle cards in your hand.  If you hate Munchkin, I think there are better options out there for you.  For those who enjoy Munchkin, this might be a gateway into better games, so maybe that's a positive."

43,Pershon,7,"First play was enjoyable, but seemed very very short.  If someone were to buy just the base game they will find the replay-ability VERY limiting.  However, with each expansion it adds a lot of content.  The rule book is very poor and leaves you with an immense amount of questions as people use threat cards.  However, with all the short comings it contains much of the charm that we've come to love from Munchkin games.  I can see how strategy will change with each play, and it is also nice that each character offers different abilities.  I think there should be more ways to lower another players fame, as to prolong the game, because I ended, and subsequently won, the game on my 4th turn.  We played with the core box and stretch goals.  It is definitely something that is easy to teach and play, once you understand basic concepts, although set-up is a bit tedious.  All together a 7 seems fair, but as I play more it may go up or down."

45,PoorJester,4,The art work is very funny as role playing is portrayed in a humoristic way. They game mechanism forces you to be malicious as you play cards against the other players hindering them in their advance. As to me I don’t like that.

51,slickpig,6,"Must have extra dice, game feels awkward and broken with out them, we havd to break out paper and pencil to write down our rolls when things got more advanced in the game. Rules need a complete rewrite, very confusing and missing information, we think we figured most of it out but would like further clarification. Also, I purchased the legendary dice, the rules state you can roll 4 dice when fully leveled up, but you only get 2 dice! So roll, remember, roll again? Very poor."

54,Vazerum,4,"I’m a huge fan of Munchkin so I went pretty all-in with this Kickstarter. Unfortunately, the game feels like it was rushed together and lacks excitement while playing. They needed to add errata to the rule book within 24 hours of people receiving their games, and there’s still a lot of things that don’t make much sense. For a fairly simple game I had 6 questions written down after the first play through that aren’t addressed in the rule book.

Outside of rules, it’s just not a fun game. There aren’t many dungeon levels so you get to the boss quickly, and because you keep respawning when you die a lot of who wins is based on turn order. You also don’t receive any threat tokens while you’re sitting in the boss level so threat cards become meaningless pretty quickly.

Lastly, something that really annoyed me is only providing one set of dice in one core game and two expansions. You have to offset your dice with the monsters you fight, so you have to remember all of the activations you choose while the monster player rolls all the dice you just rolled. It would have been a significantly better experience if two sets of dice were included.

I have been a huge fan of SJG and CMON but this is going to make me hesitate before committing to any of their Kickstarters in the future."
