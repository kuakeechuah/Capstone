7,bbhalla,8,"Initial Impression: CMON games never fail to impress me with their accessibility and component quality. This game's excellent components; wonderfully detailed minis, thick cardboard tokens and upgrades, and plastic player overlays support a really fun game that's only slightly more complicated than your average beer&pretzels affair, but with a fair amount of zany tactical depth. The game exudes a feeling of hit 80's arcade video games. Players characters are quick to die and respawn just as quickly as the monsters. Chracters run around collecting victory points, completing PvP and PvE missions, and purchasing upgrades. Picking up boosts and recharge packs further tie the theme to the mechanisms. To top it all off, progression carries over between scenarios, which are all linked to a small campaign. This game won't be for everyone but for those of us who find it charming, there's alot to love."

Quicker Set-up, shorter campaigns that you can complete quicker and still all the joys of exploding dice make for heroic saves and hilarious failures.

Two housrules established, in the upgrade Phase you (most of the times the winner of the previous game) cannot take the same upgrade twice.
And Starter is the last to choose Spaceship-docking-Spot, which is chosen anticlockwise, starting with the fourth player / sitting on the right of the first player. Works out perfect and doesn´t do the richerr is getting richer so harsh. The one winning the last game already gets at least one weapon more in the upgrade phase - but taking two of a kind, seemed unfair and overpowered...."
25,Digimortal,8,"Having just got this, I had no expectations outside of other CMON games which were are generally simple, silly but provide some tactical choices throughout to make things interesting.

Well this is a real surprise, but I got this and found I love it! Despite being the simplest game in my collection, my wife and I were laughing at the ridiculous stalemate we created and the victory she lorded over me. the theme is fun and silly, great for kids and enjoyable for adults.

The Kickstarter content provides some great parody figures to play with, the sculpts look awesome and I have to say the expansions provide some pretty thematic and fun monsters and scenarios.

My only criticism would be that each scenario needs a narrative intro & debrief to help cement the fun world they created in the manuals."

And a bunch of extras :D It finally came and we played through the campaign in the base box. It certainly makes Arcadia faster, especially the set up, which is great. I was worried about only having 2 heroes but to be honest, I never felt like I was missing anything. It's true that the 3rd one is not used as often in Arcadia, I guess. I also like that the campaign only has 4 scenarios instead of 6, it is much easier to play through it this way. As with Arcadia, it will not be a game that we will play often (at least until we have a kid old enough) but I know I will always enjoy it."

68,Maitreya,7.5,"Initial thoughts (3 plays - rated 7.5):
I played the main campaign in Arcadia Quest all the way through once and some one-off missions (14 plays).  I enjoyed it, but didn't love it as much as I hoped.  Yet, like the fool I am, I couldn't resist trying out the format with a sci-fi skin (love that much more than fantasy), especially since they were making some gameplay changes that sounded interesting.  I think initially I do enjoy Starcadia Quest more than AQ, but still undecided if its worth a spot on my shelf long term.

First, I'm not a very big fan of campaign games.  For me, there's just not enough 'story' in almost all games to make me want to deal with the headache of tracking changes between plays and trying to round everybody up to knock out a whole campaign in short order before everybody loses interest.  I really do love picking out gear in games, which is what campaign games seem to excel out.  IMO, you can easily implement that in a standalone mission game, but for some reason there aren't a lot that do it, at least that I'm aware of.  Both AQ & SQ seem to do it just fine. I don't need to string together some missions to feel like my characters are getting 'stronger.'  If SQ stays on my shelf, it may end up being mostly for standalone missions.

Since I'm talking about campaigns, it should be noted the SQ campaign is only 4 missions and I believe the AQ one was 6.  I find that a little easier to knock out so that's a plus for SQ.  Since I just finished mission 3, I'm not sure if the last mission will be as not fun to replay as I found the final mission in AQ to be.  

I enjoy having a team of 2 characters much more  than 3, especially since each one has more upgrade slots.  It allows you to play around more with character builds.

Love having random map tiles instead of a preset map.  Much quicker to set up and a lot more variety for replayability.

I knew going into this game how much randomness there is, but I still wish it was less so.  I just got steamrolled in our 3rd campaign mission because I couldn't roll bursts to save my life, but the winner was getting them left and right.

Overall, this is a simple, bash everybody up kind of game, which shouldn't be taken too seriously.  Looks to have a ton of fun combos to try out.  Want to play it with my 9 year old to see if it's a hit with him."

Very streamlined sequel to AQ. 

Pros:
- Great CMON production as usual
- Reduced overhead with set up via random dungeon generation. Streamlined set up and player trays are top notch. 
- Plays fast, very accessible campaign. Tons of content

Cons:
- RNG - event deck for monster activations can create a lot of pile on the leader situation and leave little to strategy. Feels heavy handed at times
- Campaign progression is not very satisfying based off the core game. Leveling up equipment and the drafting process feels underwhelming
- Lack of narrative element in campaign, no inter connectivity between mission to simulate progression. "

110,Turin14,9,"Kickstarter has arrived with all the expansions and extras!  Everything looks awesome, and even without playing the game I can see that this will be a more polished design, and quicker to play.  I appreciate the thought that went into organizing and storing the game.  Some promos don’t have a place to fit, but it seems to work for now.  Looking forward to playing soon!

After our first game, I’m already excited by all of the improvement to the game.  Faster setup, quicker turns, more engaging monsters and better player interaction.  The upgrade phase is even more exciting, since you get more equipment, and also have more slots, yet you still feel like it’s a tough choice since they are all good!  I can already tell that progression between scenarios is going to be greater than in Arcadia Quest.  Looking forward to seeing how this first Campaign plays out!"
111,umekichi,N/A,Ks
112,Valk,2,"Rating is based on rulebook and Kickstarter, can change.

Everything seems like a rehash of Arcadia Quest, with no noteworthy changes other than it being 2 heroes per player ( I consider 3 to be better).  

What's worse is the color schemes chosen. The board, tokens, and other components make this a rainbow colored eyesore. The minis however, do seem better details if the produced minis stay true to the kickstarter images. 

All in all, just get Arcadia Quest (with multiple expansions including pets and mounts) instead of waiting many months for this."
113,VendettaGorgon,8,I wish I could play this more
114,VictorViper,8,"Tons and tons of fun. Plays great at 2, which was a nice surprise.

Dumb fun, pure beer n' pretzels, but with enough tactical space to rise above plain-stupid."

116,Walt Mulder,7.9,Combat is akin to running around in the dark with a lit sparkler sticking out of your butt.
117,Warren Gleeson,7,"A good fun game which is more streamlined than Arcadia Quest.  I'm unsure about the dynamics change from 3 to 2 characters.  It seems to play as fast even with the quest cards which bring another dimension to the game.  The scenarios are OK, but seem to lack any real story, the random tile selection, whilst offering replayability, doesn't make the scenarios feel defined (or even relevant - just random events in a chain of events). 

The card pieces are of high quality, but the player boards and game cards are flimsy and curl.  Even the base boards despite being nice and thick warp even after being kept under heavy books overnight.   The figures are great and really bring the games to life.  There are enough dice included to play the game, but not really enough dice to avoid constantly passing them around - this is more frustrating with more players (personal preference, I will be looking to buy more).

The game is quick to pick up from the rulebook, which is easy to read with plenty of examples.  There are a few things which I need to find more clarity on (what is a badge, and how do you get one? - I assume that I must keep missing the rule when I re-read the rulebook)."
118,WasabiWarden,10,"Just throwed in a few training rounds with my 11y daughter, it was so much fun. I'd say if the kid is even remotely interested in board games the age recommendation should be around 8-10 (her native language is not en). This game is another good example of well made game and the minis etc. are for sure interesting to younger ones, nice way to get our kids to get their eyes off from the phones or console games. By far more inspiring and fun."
