+ Artwork
+ Variability: monsters, weapons, upgrade cards, scenario cards, map tiles, story cards)
+ Modular, random map (exploration)
+ Special scenario rules (scenario cards)
+ Campaign and non-campaign mode
+ Hand cards are used to do actions (e.g., move, pick up, or draw event cards). However, these cards are also used for combat so the more actions you spend the less options you have left in combat
+ Combat by choosing and placing cards in an activation order
+ Upgrade cards for deck building. The cards determine the play style, e.g., tank or healer, slow or fast initiative. These cards are kept during campaign play.
+ Monster react by drawing from an AI card deck. Each monster has a different behavior. Monster also respawn and move at the end of the round
+ Weapons have 2 sides (flip cardboard) that allow different play stiles
+ Random encounters / story cards
+ Hunt track creates time pressure

Now I receive the all-in KS and pay 50 € for shipping. I expect at least a very heavy XXXL - oversized box or at least 3 big boxes. So where is the problem with all the 1-ratings because of shipping costs?

I hope that this game is at least as good the PS4-game. 

After receiving the game and playing it, I will change or confirm this rating based on the game (and not on the shipping costs)."

41,Death4AllAges,N/A,"Many are complaining that CMON was dishonest about shipping, well CMON made it clear that they were not absorbing the shipping. Many, and I mean many, paid a very reasonable shipping fee. I will admit that there are also those who seem to have gotten ridiculous shipping costs, but again this has NOTHING to do with the game, and much more to do with how much it actually costs to ship something this size. CMON has been very open to refunding (granted, holding 10% for fees) anyone whose shipping cost was high.

It should be noted that the $10-$20 US shipping was for a standard 4kg package, the end product was much higher and other than some rare cases (NZ and some Middle Eastern countries I understand) the rate actually works out to be what CMON ended up charging. There is some fluctuation based on location in the tune of ~$15, but people were expecting $10-$20 shipping for the end package weight when the estimate was for a 4kg package."

You have rejected and denied every single solution I suggested to resolve this very bad situation I have been put into due to your outrageous shipping costs that have been increased to more than four folds to the amount mentioned in the campaign..!!

I would understand a slight increase due to the stretch goals added at the last hours but THIS (from $35 to $136) is unreasonable and just plain insanity..!!

Unfortunately for you, you are loosing your customers and people are writing about your greedy shipping costs that have multiplied many folds than suggested earlier everywhere over the internet ..!!

Although I have admired your board games for so long and bought a lot of your previous games, this was my FIRST kick-starter pledge for CMON and most definitely the LAST..!!

It is such a shame that the board games that we have known and loved are being degraded and contaminated with the greediness of the currently purely business oriented company that created them..!!

You have lost me as a customer and as a big fan or your games and most probably many others outraged like me.. !!

154,Skitch_,N/A,"Currently backing on KS but thinking of dropping. The miniatures look amazing. The Bloodborne IP is fantastic, but CMON seems to be slapping Eric Lang's name on everything these days. Certainly they are relying on the miniatures yet again to sell another game but it feels like there is a distinct lack of urgency, tension, and difficulty that oozes from the video game. From what I have seen of the gameplay it looks shallow and hollow. The board game will never be able to replicate what the video game offers - punishing boss fights that require focus, quick reaction, smart decision making, problem solving, and urgency. You don't get a break in the video game, ever, which leads to a fantastic sense of accomplishment when you overcome the game. This board game feels like it lacks the reward for playing it. It will sell because of the emotional ties people have to the video game. And it has Eric Lang's name on it. And it is CMON. And it is miniatures. There will be staunch defenders of the game because they love the IP. CMON truly has mastered the prescription for selling board games."

Furthermore, the game is scenario based, limiting replayability, unless you buy multiple (over-priced) add-ons, making the core game only part of the full game experience. Chalice Runs and PvP content to extend replayability seem uninteresting and tacked on.

Endless KS exclusives and add-ons force people to go all-in for $300+. Quite risky, since there are currently 0 real gameplay videos available. We only have the word of the designer this game will be great. $300 will buy you a lot of board games with a proven track record."

I am looking to buy full KS at a discounted price, maybe I will wait in late 2020 or later for used copy to be on sale. $200+ is little above my price point for this game

Combination of betrayal of the haunted house and deck building game. Card Combat feels a little like the card game version or Gloomhaven.

I really like the combat system and the upgrades, but that being said i dont think this game has enough content in story length especially compare to betrayal of the haunted house or Gloomhaven. I think most of the $$$ is going to be in large bundle of mininatures that most player are forced to pay for. Gloomhaven also has a better combat system than Bloodborne and Gloomhaven difficultly can be changed to be harder or easier. Bloodborne difficulty is fixed, and I didnt find it to be ""hard"" like designer suggested it to be in a 5 player game. However it could be more difficult with less players if the everything stays the same (overall, less players to tank damage I think would be major factor). Inside dungeon stuff is great,  but Gloomhaven has more monsters per a dungeon session while betrayal is better at event encounters. This game feels in between those 2 games in that sense. For the cost of the game, I recommend gloomhaven overall $100, 100 scernarios, 17 characters, tons of stuff or betrayal of the haunted house for the horror/encounters, I think this game is way too expensive. Considering that major components are cards, you could technically wait to make an PnP version of this game if someone was nice enough to scan all the cards and/tiles, and use filler monster tokens/mininatures to play this game... and it might be worth it to save $200+."
