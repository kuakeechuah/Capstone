2,Abdul,6,"Decent but forgettable. I would have expected at least some names for the various cards to inject a little theme into the gameplay. Just too dry and simple for me. The marble dispenser is cute, but kept breaking and dropping marbles onto the table."
3,Achire,7,"Light game. Pretty fun with all the card combos and I like the mechanics a lot. The marble randomization is pretty cool. The only thing I don't like is the game length - it feels a little too short, so it doesn't really feel like your engine actually comes together before the game ends. The super-short length also makes it really hard to come back from bad luck. So good game that I'd be happy to play, but don't feel the need to own it."

8,adamw,8,It is very fun - like a small step up from Splendor or Century Spice Road because it has combos that are quite satisfying. The end game scoring could be close - or could be a blow out depending on a few of those Level 3 cards that can really score big if combined well. Very fun and delightful in production!
9,aeaswen,8,This is a great game for what it is. A light game that is quick that will introduce players to engine building and combo type games. I have enjoyed every play of it.
10,ahwood23,N/A,"I really want to try this, but have so many unplayed games, maybe I should trade it?"
11,Ajax,7,Really nice engine-building game.  It ramps up well from truly simple to slightly mind-melting.  Almost goes on a little long.  Good use of iconography and insert.
12,ajax013,8,"+ Great match of simple rules with escalating gameplay; as silly as it is, the energy dispenser adds a lot to the appeal of this game.
- I actually wish that the four energy types weren't symmetric in what they offer... it would have been cool is heat energy was somehow inherently different than atomic energy, etc."
13,ajewo,7.5,"Action selection game with card drafting. Players are tinkers who build gizmos. Colored marbles represent power required for the colored cards (gizmos). A three dimensional cardboard cue shows which marbles come next. 

Pros:
+ Components (tactile, big marbles, marble tower)
+ Built gizmos grant special powers, e.g., converters, additional marbles (engine building)
+ Upgrade your stats
+ Convert marbles give flexibility
+ Satisfying combo building that mixes short-term and mid-term planing
+ Quick playing time

Neutrals:
# Rather abstract game
# Random draw of marbles
# Family game
# Higher player counts create more unpredictability for the available marbles.

Cons:
- Starts a bit slow
- Over the course of the game, there are a lot of triggered effects to keep track of (potential analysis paralysis may slow down the game)

Similar games:
* Mechanica (factory, spatial puzzle, swingy market, cool theme integration)
* Potion Explosion (very luck-based)"
14,Al Capwnd You,9,"Gismos feels like a lighter version of Terraforming Mars in terms of an engine builder. A card-and-marble engine building game where you can chain/domino abilities. The marbles might initially think of a kid's game, but there is a good bit of strategy to make an efficient engine work towards earning you points and not just spinning its wheels.

Terraforming Mars feels like it is a more mature game with more depth, but Gizmos is easier to get to the table for a family. If you enjoy engine builders, Gizmos is a great addition as a lightweight introductory game that will still be fun after the initial play."

Most importantly, the theme and components mean your turns are fun to map out and just as fun to watch the other player's gizmos chain together."
23,andshar,7.5,"Fun, fast light/filler game. It is possible for someone to get a great combo working and run away with the game."
24,Andy Parsons,6,"A simple engine builder with the gimmick of a cardboard marble dispenser. The marbles are resources used to purchase new engine parts.  A limited set of dispensed marbles and players' limited capacity to store them place constraints on the engine parts you can buy.  I found Gizmos quick and inoffensive and forgettable.

Production quality is mostly good, though the engine part cards are a little thin.  The artwork is functional."

38,arildoaim,7.6,"Good engine builder that replaces Azul for me in the ""superfiller""-niche. Fast game, but packing. Elegant design. Family friendly. Effortless to bring to the table.

Playing this after Tapestry was a great relievement.

Concerns:
- Needs some plays to see if still holds up, or gets samey.
- Some strategies are clearly superior? Can be migiated by houserouling.
- Turns can be very fast, so if one particular player got AP it will be noticable."
39,Arkeas,5,Light little engine building game. Simple to teach and play but the game becomes quite dull and repetitive after just a few plays and the choices are never particularly interesting. Ended up trading this one.

46,autothrall,7.1,"Very direct engine builder which relies heavily on your ability to put together chain reactions that net you more value. Fun stuff and plays differently enough from other popular games of its niche (Splendor, etc) that it's worth checking out. The energy marble are a neat touch although with some play the cardboard tabs on the dispenser have started to peel apart, so that particular component could be better if plastic."

UPDATE: A truly elegant design, simple but not simplistic. It looks nice on the table (although I do join others saying that the ball dispenser has its issues). It's a cery interesting engine-building game that my girlfriend liked (and that could be enough for me already). Component quality is great for the price-point of this game. I can only hope for future expansions that could eleviate my sole minor problem with the game with 2p, which is that is can bog down when the balls available do not match the available cards, something that prolongs the game, making both players huffing and puffing for a break.

71,bhudson1972,7,"Very clever game. It is more strategic than it looks. Can actually become quite heated as players select cards that others are waiting to build. Often, a card will come out that you want, but it will get selected prior to your turn coming back around. The contraption that holds the marbles works well enough. I could see it getting worn down and tearing up at some point. I think this game has a good look that will get people to ask about it. Very fun."
72,biasedisland,8,What a great little engine builder! Think Splendor with marbles but better. One of our favorites behind Wingspan. We love the light theme. It's strategic and plays very fast. Seems to scale very well IMO. Would highly recommend.
73,BigD527,7,"I like the engine-building twist of this one, and the fact that it has a significant tactile component gives it nice table appeal. A solid gateway."
74,Billnyhilist,7,"Really nice little engine builder, feels a bit barebones for some reason even though you have a handful of strategies and actions to build upon; perhaps because the gizmos all feel so abstract and unthematic?

I heard that it is Splendor with some Potion Explosion mixed in. It definitely felt like it has the good parts of both of the two.
The individual turns, although you combo up many things, don't take so long (unlike Potion Explosion, which had issue with too long individual turns and big downtime). 
The combos towards the end get huge, maybe a bit too much even.
Liked it.

101,brw12,7,"Really enjoyed my first play. Like a combination between Splendor and 7 Wonders. Building the engine is satisfying, and there are always several good choices.

Several of the mechanics are really satisfying, and the components are well done and make collecting the energy marbles fun. I loved doing ""research"", building capacity, and hitting a chain I've set up.

The theme felt flat to me, though. There is no connection between the colors/types of energy and any particular functions; for a game with a seemingly strong theme, the cards are completely divorced from it and feel interchangeable. (That aspect is similar to Forbidden Island.)

The game also felt a bit long and anticlimactic, finishing with an ""okay, everyone count their points"" shrug. The rules didn't help, because they buried several key rules and left them in the middle of paragraphs of text.

Last, there's no clear way to keep track of which cards have been used during a chain reaction and which haven't.

All that said, it has a very fun core mechanic, scan if it's not the finely tuned machine that 7 Wonders or Dominion are.

I already have Quadropolis, Sagrada, and probably will have Azul at some point. This isn't as good as any of those, but there is something very lovable about how much more wacky this is from a gameplay perspective. Do I need another entry level drafting game? Definitely not.

The combos are really rewarding, and allow for different approaches each game. Sometimes you get an amazing ""File/Build"" combo, which incentivizes you to build from your Archive instead of from the center of the table. Other games, you might develop a poweful ""Pick"" action and choose to spend more of your turns doing that. It's neat.

Thankfully, unlike Potion Explosion (which has a similar marble dispenser), the setup and take-down for this is much faster and easier. Definitely a keeper for us."

This is a good entry-level engine building game, as all of the card powers are simple, but the trick is putting things together in the right combination to put together a powerful machine.

As a seasoned gamer, I will say this game does fall into one of my pet peeves for games: the illusion of a large variety of cards. There really aren't that many unique powers or abilities on this game, as many of the cards are the same ability, just replicated 4 times in each of the 4 colors of resources or buildings. While the game is still fun, I personally enjoy more varied abilities in my engine-builders, but I also understand it would take away from some of the simplicity here.

Overall, if you like engine builders, grab it, particularly if you're looking for a simple one that still packs a punch."

148,ciggie,7,"Clever engine builder with a marble gimmick for your resources that makes the game a bit different and fun. Normally you can pick a marble from one of the six that come out the chute, but special gizmos also let you pick blind from the top. I like this better than Potion Explosion because of the cool combos you can pull off by converting 1 marble into different/multiple marbles, and then the combos you can chain together when you take 1 of the 4 main actions. Iconography is fairly clear and the game is pretty easy to explain which is nice. I did find it odd we did not really use the research action, but I guess that comes from knowing the cards a bit better than we all did on our first play. 

Another play and it just feels a bit too simple, no real cool actions (typically just more marbles, convert marbles, or gain a couple of points). Games like Splendor, Century Spice Road, and Dice Forge do this genre better but the marbles do make it unique. I'm not sure how much staying power this has, but for how quick it plays it may stick around a little longer."

The marbles and the device that dispenses them are not necessary to the game (could have accomplished the same thing with tokens and a bag) but they add a flair that I will admit did increase my enjoyment level."

160,CoreySanders,6,"Gizmos wins on simple, fast turns and the quirky marble tower gimmick. It loses on repetitive, overly simple card powers. It also slightly overstated its welcome at the table and failed to deliver a novel/memorable experience. Not a bad game, but mostly meh. I’d rather play Deus for a similar but more meaty experience."
161,Corsairs,7,"Like a marriage of ""Splendor"" and ""Potion Explosion,"" ""Gizmos"" is a colorful blast of strategic engine-building. Start your engine with a few basic gizmos, then build up to the mid-levers, working to activate combos with your complete gizmo stable. The game lacks ""Splendor's"" simple elegance, yet it makes up for that with greater strategic consideration. Fun, but a little too slight for me to want to play often.

177,darkbanan,5,"Cool marble gimmick, unfortunately the game is mediocre at best. Lot's of better engine builders out there."
178,darker,8,"It's action chaining: the card game! I enjoy that sort of thing, and appreciate that this one seems resistant to hyperfocusing: in one game, a player managed to get out a bunch of early cards that highly rewarded Archiving cards then building them from his Archive, and we thought he had the game in the bag... but all the rewards were similar, which meant he couldn't actually make good (or any) use of all of them. My engine took easily 2-3x as long to come online, but was much more robust - I was able to build a new Gizmo nearly every turn.

The central gimmick - the marble pit - was fun and worked well. What we chose to build was informed at least somewhat by game context - e.g., during early-to-mid-game, we had a very strong streak of Yellow marbles and a very strong streak of no Yellow gizmos. And the limits on marbles/archived cards/cards looked at with the Research(?) action were a neat form of upgrade that we always cursed not having built the turn before.

The presentation was also really good - having the separate areas for each type of trigger made it a *lot* easier to manage/understand your engine.

My primary concern is longer-term replayability; there's only a modest number of Gizmo types. Having a wider variety and/or some other source of game-to-game variance (e.g., objectives) would give it a boost."

Good:
* Fast turns help get to combo-building quickly.
* Different paths to specialize in each game.
* Reaching in for marbles.

Not so good:

This game is very simple and a great gateway to learn engine building, the only downside is for the first 2 games, there are lots of icons to remember, but once this done the turns are very quick with a low downtime.

Cons:
- Replayability is low as what you do in the game is largely the same between plays. Highly tactical.
- First edition cardboard marble dispenser can lose some marbles that fall out of the bottom and are not found until the game is over.
- Highly abstracted theme.
- It would be a great family game but it has a few concepts that are a bit foreign to newbies and at the same time rather simplistic for gamers."

It's especially appealing to me as I am an experimental physicist and a big Phil Walker-Harding fan (Bärenpark, Imhotep, Sushi Go, Cacao, Archaeology). The game has a nice arc: an initial slow build of Gizmos to a thrilling cascade of triggering effects. It taps that same euphoria that Ganz Schön Clever has for me recently.

The manual is absolutely excellent. The iconography is very good and I am impressed with the clarity of the game space as the Gizmos build - choices and actions are clear. The game ends at a good point, just when it starts becoming a challenge to track the triggering Gizmos.

The marble dispenser is itself an excellent, elegant gizmo. It keeps the pick and draw actions snappy. And it makes an attractive table presence! Using a deck of cards or a bag of chits in its place would have been a fiddly mess."

251,enzo622,7,"The foundation of the game is buying – wait for it – bonus power cards and building your own bonus power engine. The way you do that is by paying for the cards with marbles. You select the marbles from a tray of marbles on offer. Red, blue, yellow, and black marbles each build their respective color card types.

The cards do everything from helping you select more marbles with a single action, hold more marbles (you’re initially limited to 5 which makes the bigger cards impossible to buy), and use marbles more efficiently, for colors beyond their own, etc. 

It plays quickly and is a quarter-drop game. Had a bad game of it? Drop another quarter and have a go. It’s short enough to play a few back to back."

Once you are playing it is pretty straight forward and easy to play, but the iconography could have been much better and often we had to refer to the cheat sheet over and over for very similar effects.

The marble mechanic here is actually pretty good. All of us were concerned it was simply a gimic but the game has two specific mechanics  for the marbles, picking from those in view and blind draw, of course this could have been achieved in other ways but honestly I quite like the dice 'machine' here,

The only thing that held the game up was the research action where it can cause some downtime while a number of cards are looked through. However, I think that the time spent on this would decrease dramatically with more familiarity of the game. The artwork is nice and the iconography is easy to understand after a few minutes of play. Overall a good game that I would like to play again if I get the chance."

308,GhostInside,9,"Fantastic engine-builder.  Cute, fast, easy to explain, easy for new players to pick it up.
Most of the people I have introduced this game to have purchased it shortly afterwards.
However, it IS extremely lightweight once you figure out how it works.  And that leads to the feeling that you have ""played out"" the game if sticking to rules-as-written.
But once you start adding house rules (like taking the pure-VP cheese cards out of the deck) it starts getting interesting again."

321,GoingTopShelf,8,"Phil Walker-Harding hits another home run for me and my family with Gizmos. The chaining effects in this game are pure awesomeness. The look on my son's face was pure joy when he built a gizmo that allowed him to take a pick action which allowed him to take another pick action, which allowed him to, etc. etc.  I worried that the chaining of effects would become overwhelming as you can only use the effect on each card once, but there's just enough going on where you feel super cool when you chain 3-4 things together, but rarely do those effects become difficult to track. I also love that good play is rewarded and there can be wide discrepancies in points. The negative of this is that the game can be exhilarating or deflating depending on how the game flows. This is a perfect mix of light enough for newcomers but strategic enough for hobbyists."

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2019)

I have never liked an original game from Cool Mini or Not, so I wasn’t expecting much from Gizmos and my expectation was met. Gizmos can be a good family game but it´s not for me.

Gizmos´ rules are easy to learn and each. You can teach the game under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 75 minutes.

The game´s components are very good as is usual from CMON. Gizmos has a cool gimmick, in this case, a marble dispenser, that is pretty useful, but it´s a gimmick nonetheless. The same result could have been done by drawing enough marbles out of a bag, but that´s not CMON´s way and, I confess, it´s cool to have very good looking gimmicks in your games. The rest of the components are ok. The art is ok as well.

The theme is exciting, cool and novel BUT you don´t really feel it during the game :(. When I bought Gizmos, for some unknown reason I thought it was something like TIM (The Incredible Machine), a mechanical physics puzzle but it not. Gizmos is an engine builder game.

Gameplay isn’t exciting for me as he decisions needed to play the game are rather obvious. Each turn you have to choose one action from 4 available:

•	File: Allows you to save a card from the ones available for future construction.  You have an initial limit of 1 card but that can be expanded with other cards.

•	Pick:  Allows you to take marbles (resources) from the available ones to build the cards. You have an initial limit of 5 marbles but that can be expanded with other cards.

•	Build: Allows you to build cards from the display (obviously) or from the one you got with the File action. To build you need to play the correct marbles.

•	Research: Allows you to draw a certain amount of cards from the decks and you can File/Build them.

Every time you take an action you also need to see which bonuses you have from your constructed cards (thus the engine part of the game). You are trying to chain/combo as most effects as you can. As you can see, the game is fairly easy ruleswise and choosing the best option for you isn’t very hard. 

I feel the game has a considerable luck factor with the cards (high luck) and the marbles (moderate luck) . There are ways to mitigate it, but it´s present. 

Replayability seems high because there are lots of cards but many of them seem very similar, I would need more plays to verify this but I don’t think I will play more Gizmos.

For me, Gizmos is at the same level of Potion Explosion. Both are very cool looking games, but shallow in the decisions department. On the same topic I also don´t like Splendor or Century and all three games share some mechanisms. 

Bottom line, Gizmos is a good family game, but it´s not for me. I crave heavier experiences and Gizmos offer easy decisions in a very good looking package. I feel the luck of the draw can easily decide who wins. The game bores me a bit. I will sell it ASAP.

Current Rating : 4.0"
386,jgunnz,7.5,"The system is clever. Use energy marbles to power ""gizmos"" and create chain reactions with other gizmos.  There are only 4 actions, ""pick"", ""build"", ""research"", and ""file"" - research is rarely used thus, there are really only 3 actions . . . so the combos are somewhat limited as a result. I am looking forward to potential expansions that can add upon this clever system. Right now this is a lightweight entry level game in the same vein as Splendor. With some expansions it might hit more of a sweet spot but definitely a solid game as is."

392,JoeAubrey,8,"I learned this with a friend and after the first game he immediately said, ""Let's play that again."""
393,joetweber,8,A family favorite. My kids love the engine-building and the tactile nature of the marbles. I love the approachable yet satisfying engine-building and the simplicity of each turn (only 4 actions) makes this game easy to introduce to new and experienced gamers alike.
394,joewyka,7,"Gizmos feels like a game for people who enjoy Splendor, but want there to be more to it than just trading gems for cards ever more efficiently. That's also essentially what you are doing in Gizmos, but rather than cards just giving you energy of a certain color, they enhance your actions. Enhanced actions can potentially grant additional actions which in turn can be modified to grant other actions. Late in the game, you can have some pretty big turns! The basic actions are the same as in Splendor - File (Reserve a Card), Pick (Take an Energy), and Build (Buy a Card) - with the addition of a new action: Research (Draw x cards from the top of a face down deck and build or file one). Like in Splendor, the available cards are tiered in three levels with escalating costs, benefits and points. The game ends when a player's tableau has 16 cards or 4 top tier cards. A full 2-player game can be played in 20-30 minutes, with maybe 10-15 minutes added per additional player.

One aspect that I'm not sure I like as much as Splendor is that you have six randomly available energy colors at any given moment, which makes that aspect of the game less planful than with Splendor. This is offset by purchasing cards that can mitigate some of this risk by converting one energy to two or giving you the ability to exchange one color for another. It is less difficult to buy cards in Gizmos as the game focuses much more on building cool combos than striving for valuable and expensive cards. Energy is represented by marbles which are dispensed from a large marble machine, making the box much larger than the game play really warrants. I don't know about this one. It's enjoyable, but I think I can get just as much enjoyment from other engine builders in a MUCH smaller box."

451,Lapsus,5.5,"I was expecting more.  The box looks great, the marble dispenser was intriguing and I love Walker-Harding.  But Gizmos is ultimately a simple tableau & engine building a la splendor with unattractive visuals & dry gameplay.  There's a significant luck component with the choices being entirely tactical and almost no strategy.  The marble gimmick is cute but ultimately unnecessary.  There's lots of 'mechanics' and iconography with make play slightly more complex than splendor for no real benefit, and I'm not a fan of splendor (which I think is that game that plays itself).  Anyway, I love Walker-Harding but this one falls flat."

Enjoy this one although there can be overpowered combos if the players allow them to occur - or at least that was one experience. Plays very quickly and you do want to focus pretty quickly if possible for maximum chain reaction benefits."
453,Lawster,6.5,"A good puzzle game to set up combos and get your engine running. The plastic marbles are nice. I like the bubbles inside to give the marbles visual texture. The theme is meh though. Feels like I'm back in grad school with all of the ""filing"" and ""research"" going on. A better theme and artwork would have upped my rating. Iconography is good on the cards, although the attempt at using color blind symbology is a waste and confusing for new players since the marbles don't have the same symbols on them."

2. Sammeln: Eine Energiekugel (Baumaterial, Murmel) aus 6 zur Verfügung stehenden herausnehmen und lagern.
3. Bauen: Einen Gizmos aus der mittleren Auslage in einen Slot bauen. Die verschiedenen gizmos verstärken:
a) Upgrades: Lagerfähigkeit von Kugeln, Gizmos, Forschung.
b) Umwandler: Fähigkeit zum tauschen von Energiekugeln.
c) Speichernfähigkeit, Sammelnfähigkeit, Bauenfähigkeit und Forschenfähigkeit: beim Ausführen einer dieser Aktionen erhält man Bonusaktionen.

These type of games always 'feel' fun to play due to their simple, addictive game play.  However, is there any real substance to this game?  After 2 plays, I'm not sure there is.  It was fun due to the rush you get from growing stronger as you play, but does it do anything significant enough to be worth owning?  At first glance, the abilities you could gain didn't appear to be that interesting and tended to be fairly repetitive.

If the icons were improved or if there was more text to decipher them, I would bump the rating a full point.  2nd play - was ok, cards already starting to seem a bit samey.  Could use an expansion.

Gizmos feels like a solid engine builder that is easy to play, fast to tear up and take down, and plays very quickly. Just as the combos are really about to go nuts, the game is pretty much over, which is perfect.

I have the 2nd edition with the plastic tray and it's a must; I don't know why CMON didn't fully learn their lesson from PE, but such is life.

575,NowOrNever88,7,"First play. Tied 15 cards and VP with another then he had more energy cubes so he won but came second in a 4p in about an hour. Smidge disappointing. The energy row was all black a while which seemed just a smidge chance/random based as did drawing for Research actions. Had a very tiny smidge of trouble telling red and yellow when light came on it but mostly could tell the colors 99% fine. Seemed decent in planning and engine building but I'dve preferred less randomness (ex in Splendor always having the gems available). The iconography took some getting used to but was fine, and the different engines and actions were understandable and mostly fine but mainly the lack of planning of what was available to build and what gems I could pick hurt the experience a smidge. Theme is better than Wingspan birds but honestly didn't pay much attention to art and such, and he marbles seem a pain for getting lost or accidentally rolling around too. Played with 1st edition marble cardboard so they got stuck a smidge. Imo this should've been a simpler card game instead of the gimmick. Would've preferred more control in the card turnout and less of the random marbles or effects like 'pick random ? Marble blindly' but was still semi decent engine builder. 6/10

Played twice more at 3 player in about one hour per play. Kinda annoying to plan but did win twice at 30-40 pts range and can see a lot of different viable strategy plus the icons became more accustomed with plays and randomness of row was better mitigated with more picks or card synergy. Overall a better impression but compared to Splendor or Century Golem, I'm not sure I actually like this more. There's certainly more to think of and consider and was enjoyable, but there's no strong pull back and the feel of the engine building didn't actually feel more satisfying per se than Splendor or Century already. And Century itself was still just more ""fun"" imo. Though I do like this same with Splendor ish. One wish was the marble dispenser wasn't as tall to block vision and honestly wouldn't have minded just cards to condense the game a lot instead of marbles. But still a pretty decent engine building game. 7/10 now and wouldn't mind playing more but not craving to.

Plays: 6+ good and solid engine builder that's harder to master than Splendor and I think tighter too. Still annoyed at marbles but pretty good gateway+ game ish imo"

583,oatmeal1201,7,"Played once at Dice Tower Con 2018. This is like Splendor with crazy combos. This is not like potion explosion. 

Basic gameplay is take marbles from the track and use them to build cards. Once you have your engine down, doing an action or playing a card can trigger another action, which can trigger another action, which could potentially...well, you get the idea. From what I remember, the game ends when 16 cards are built. 

There are also three rows of cards which reminded me of Splendor. The easy to build, medium, and hard to build. You can also take and reserve cards. 

Only played once but needs more plays to see what kind of cards are out there."

587,Official Avem,7,"Fun, tactile game. Love the use of marbles as a resource because it sets it apart from other games. My major issue with Gizmos is that the cards which award VPs for building certain colours, combined with cards that allow you to take pick actions for building certain colours create a strategy that I have found to be too reliable. I find myself having to choose between making a fun engine which may not do well, or building the above strategy which will almost always win but is getting dull now."

I only subtracted one point because there's no player interaction at all - the ""gizmos market"" should have added some interaction but after the game unfolds a little everyone is just using their Search ability, ignoring the market.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I know a lot of folks who enjoy Gizmos, so I took advantage of the library at a local con and got to finally play it. The art and components themselves are lackluster, granted we were playing a first edition copy of the game and the new edition is supposed to have a better marble dispenser. I was really put off by the artwork and graphic design though, the machines look really simple and generic; it is disappointing when a clever game like Gizmos doesn't have great art.

With that said the actual game play is fun, you are racing to build an efficient machine to produce points. The question the game presents is which efficiency path do you want to take; there are 5 or 6 different parts of your machine you can upgrade which then make the different actions more beneficial. The marble mechanic is novel and well integrated into the design as well. Gizmos plays quick, is easy to learn and while I've only played a 3p game I see no reason why it wouldn't play well at all player counts. 

I think Gizmos would be a great game for families, especially if you have younger kids. However; even though I enjoyed Gizmos, I wasn't blown away by it. A lot of it has to due with the artwork, it really turned me off of the game. And while I know the game isn't overly random I never felt in control of the engine I was building; probably due to poor play more than anything else. I can't really explain it much better than to say the game just didn't grab me, by the end I was ready to be done with the game and move on. I'd like to play again to see if my opinion of the game improves with more plays, as it stands I'd consider Gizmos a good not great game.[/i]"

610,PBrennan,7,"The marbles with the dispenser provide some wow factor (but honestly could have just as easily been done with a deck of cards). Your turn is to collect a resource or buy a card with a power, adding it to your tableau. Eventually you'll build a little engine of complementary card powers where buying cards will either give you resources (ie the marbles), or allow you to convert resources into other colours, or provide discounts (and so on and so on). The faster you can buy, and the better cards you can buy, the more VPs. So yep, it's a nice engine building game. There’s the ability to claim/reserve a card if you’re desperate to have it as it’s not uncommon to have the card you covet “stolen” just before you’re ready to build - early on you can assess how safe you are because you can see what marbles people are collecting, but once the converter powers kick in, it’s all too hard. What's different from most purchase games is that the cards are mono-coloured rather than the usual mixed X blue / Y red / Z black to buy this card. This speeds the game up tremendously, but at the cost of railroading you into purchasing only the cards in the marbles of the colour you’re collecting (pending powers, etc). I both liked the upside and disliked the downside simultaneously. I’m happy to sit on the fence in the meantime, and to give it another whirl if someone pulls it out given its fast gameplay."

613,Perchy,7.8,"A less-flavoursome Splendor. Aesthetically, at first, it appears to be very cool! You're an inventor and there are these marbles which represent energy and it has this cool combo-driven mechanic to building the perfect gizmo, but... Ultimately, the art on the cards are ignored because they stack atop one another, reduced to the symbols on their top. This makes the game, funnily enough, aesthetically bland, which strips the flavour of its premise away. As a result, I would firmly recommend Splendor over it."
614,PeterHendee,7,Fun little engine builder.
615,pfctsqr,6,"A bit too derivative.  The marbles could easily be replaced by cubes without any change to the gameplay, but then it probably would not get noticed.  My one play was fun, but I don't care whether or not I will play it again and I definitely will not purchase it.  Also, many of the components feel cheap.  The small player board ""strips"" are warped and started coming apart after only a couple of plays and it does not appear that the marble dispenser will hold up all that long."

620,Phrim,7,"Gizmos is a quick engine-building games. During a player’s turn, he can either buy a card from the display, take a resource ball, put a card from the display in the archive, or buy a card from the archive. Most of the cards allow you to gain bonuses when you do one of these things--for example, you could get a random ball whenever you take a yellow ball, or you could get a victory point whenever you build a red card. Other cards increase your storage capacity or let you use certain balls as wilds. The key is that all of these bonuses can chain together, so performing one action can let you do a whole bunch of other stuff. Of course, this can snowball a little for a player who gets a nice engine quickly, but the game is short enough that this doesn’t matter too much. This is a great little filler.

621,Pickletheonion,7,"Neat little game, although the simple rules were explained in an overly wordy and complicated way.

642,quietcorn,7,"This is a very fun engine building game where you select colored marbles from a dispenser, and then use those marbles to buy cards. The cards slot into different sections of your tableau, are worth points, and additionally trigger their abilities when you select certain colors of marbles, or build certain types of cards. Play time was pretty snappy with 2 players, and I do have a soft spot for this kind of unbridled engine building. In some ways it felt like a much smoother Imperial Settlers.

643,Qumpelblase,7,"Meine Meinung zu diesem Spiel ist ein großes Hin und Her. Engine Builder sind cool und auch hier kann man sich coole Strategien und Kombos zurechtlegen. Trotzdem ist die Entscheidungsfreiheit (vorallem im fortgeschrittenen Spiel) beschränkt und schon in der ersten Spielrunde einen Funken öde. Die Gizmos sind klasse designed, spielen aber keine Rolle und sind die meiste Zeit verdeckt. Und die Murmeln und der Murmelspender sind ein cooles Gimmick, das manchmal aber hängt. Alles in allem pendelt sich Gizmos auf einer starken 7 ein."

Il mix di meccaniche utilizzato è ben implementato, per cui le partite risultano piacevoli e scorrevoli nonostante ci sia pochissima interazione fra i giocatori. Se la fortuna è un fattore trascurabile, limitata quasi solo ai bonus di pesca alla cieca, la strategia di gioco non lo è affatto. Insomma un titolo colorato, divertente, semplice e strategico, consigliato un po' a tutti coloro che vogliono passare una bella oretta di divertimento con un gioco semplice ma per nulla banale.

647,Ragnarok1er,7,"[i][u]Disclaimer:[/u][/i] This is a [color=#000099][b]standalone game[/b][/color]. Its rating is based on [color=#000099][b]desire to play[/b][/color].

I found [b]Gizmos[/b] to a  remarkably similar to [i]Splendor[/i], probably too much for my taste. Judge by yourself as both games feature:
- 3 rows of cards that you can buy from, with the low-cost cards from the first row helping you buy the more expensive ones at the top ;
- a mechanism where you can reserve a card for later, gaining a resource by doing so ;
- a limit to the resources you can hold (10 gems / 6 marbles)
- a very math-y design where the theme feels pasted on and never adds anything (despite some cool illustrations, I never felt like an inventor in [b]Gizmos[/b])
- a final score quick enough to reach that the game is closer to a sprint than a marathon ;
- and even some fun material to play with (the poker chips for [i]Splendor[/i], the marble dispenser for [b]Gizmos[/b]).

Now, of course, [b]Gizmos[/b] is an engine-building game while [i]Splendor[/i] is more about set collection (there is no equivalent to the Noble tiles in [b]Gizmos[/b]). Luckily for me, my knowledge of [i]Splendor[/i] allowed me to be immediately decent at [b]Gizmos[/b]. In particular, I quickly identified that building your engine for too long is a bad thing and that you should pivot to victory points after a few turns. For more on pivot points in engine building games, read these great articles by Morten Petersen : https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/77539/pivot-points-vp-clogging-and-catchup-mechanisms & https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/85492/voluntary-and-forced-pivot-points ). That's one thing I would change about the game, by the way: getting to run your engine in full steam for a few more turns (say, end the game at 20 gizmos instead of 16) would be very satisfying and maybe even allow for some late-game strategies (like boosting your marble or research capacities) to become viable.

The one thing that sets [b]Gizmos[/b] apart is the Age III deck, which contains several cards that function very differently from the rest and allow for some different strategies like accumulating marbles. It's also the one thematic thing they have going on: the game is the mad scientist trope, yet the rest of it is very formulaic in its approach: pick a yellow resource, get a free blue one, trade it for a wild one, yawn, yawn, end my turn. By allowing the player to think outside the box a little, these cards are the best part of [b]Gizmos[/b].

Unfortunately, they are both insufficient in numbers and way too varied in power levels. The gizmos giving you 8 points for 4 marbles (all the other ones have a 1:1 ratio) are way too strong. They're supposed to have a drawback as they forbid you from using the Research action, but you can play around that very easily. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the cards giving you 1 point for 3 VP tokens are unbelievably weak.

One last gripe I have with the game: the first few turns feel very luck-based. Some age I cards feel much stronger than others, and you can get a definite advantage by getting the color you want from the top of the dispenser (where you pick a marble blindly). This lead isn't unsurmontable, but I truly felt bad for my friend when I got the right color 3 times in a row and he didn't, as if the boardgaming gods didn't want us to have a fair fight based on intellect and decision-making.

In the end, I would never turn down a game of [b]Gizmos[/b]. This may not be obvious from this review, so let me give it some love. It's fun to build your little engine and even if you're losing, the game is quick enough that it stays fun until the end. The theme is neat, the graphic design is well done, the rules unambiguous and the Age III cards offer some interesting gameplay alternatives.

I think [b]Gizmos[/b] could benefit greatly from an expansion that would add other Age III cards to make each game feel truly different, maybe even fix some of the balance and luck-based issues I have with the game. Until then, I think there are better designs out there: [i]Splendor[/i] for the tense race where no move can be wasted, and [i]Terraforming Mars[/i] or [i]Wingspan[/i] for the more thematic and satisfying engine building aspect."
648,rainbowoatmeal,8.5,"This is a fun, fast engine builder. The marble dispenser reminds me of Potion Explosion, but there’s more engine building here. The one downside is that the game is a bit fiddly, especially in the latter portions of the game.

Sometimes it feels like it's over too early. It's also not very heavy. The player boards are player aids, which is nice, but how triggers work may not be obvious to everyone from the start.

Feels a little like Century Road as you are trying to manipulate your tableau to get the most out of your turn.  It also has a little Splendor in it too as you can buy gizmos from the community pool but you can archive them to save them for yourself.   It has a little defense aspect but isn't too but overall is not too confrontational.  Really a fun interesting game with good production with the energy tower (although it was a pain to punch and get together).

697,SamLL,8,"I quite enjoyed this little engine-builder, it was satisfying putting a strategy together, it played quickly, and the toy value from the marbles was good too. Reminded me rather of Splendor with a little more explosion potential.

Gizmos has been popular among a wide range of players and doesn't wear out its welcome even after 30+ plays. I think the filing strategy might be a bit of a noob trap and the ""on build, take energy"" triggers are super important, but this isn't game breaking."

708,Scottyglc,7,"I am typically skeptical of super hyped games with a new gimmick, but Gizmos is the real deal.  The marble dispenser is a cool effect and allows you to pick or go fishing for energy you need to build new gizmos.  The meat of the game is in adding new gizmos that start to play off of each other, allowing for turns where a chain reaction can activate multiple gizmos.  This game is fairly simple to learn and plays quickly once you know it.  There isn't a ton you can do to mitigate your opponents other than trying to get gizmos they may want, so it's a race to 16 gizmos.  After not playing it for awhile, I decided to let this one go.  Sold."

In this game you collect colored balls and use those colored balls to buy different machine parts that let you pick more colored balls, store more colored balls, turn some balls into balls of other colors.  You can create really long chain reactions later in the game and if you like that style of domino engine building you might really enjoy it.

It can't create a very random distribution like something like a deck of cards can and it is really there just as an additional gimmick and that annoys me."

756,srand,5,"Clever, overproduced combo-engine-builder that feels like another iteration on Splendor++ -- about the same weight as Century: Spice Road.

This time, the cards players purchase provide bonuses when one of the main actions is taken again; bonus actions can themselves chain to other bonuses or improve other capabilities. The result is a mono-focus on combo-building. There's enough variance in the gizmos to provide some superficial variability, but that variance combined with random draws and random availability of marbles make it feel much more random than its close competitors. The research action (draw X cards from a gizmo deck and build/stash one) changes that calculus, but also reduces the competition and interactivity that arise from the market constraints in Splendor and Century.

Overall, I think good but not great. The insane marble dispenser does add to the experience but the solitary combo-building and luck of the draw are likely to be more important than the other players."

In other words, I'd probably rather play it than Splendor, but I'm not sure it's actually a better game.  I prefer the difficult decisions and combos of Century: Spice Road to either game."

779,Surya,7.2,"tl;dr: family friendly engine builder

This game is a bit like other engine builder games like Race for the Galaxy and what not, but a lot more family friendly. During the game you acquire cards that improve the power of the standard actions, trigger combos (hopefully) and give you points. As the game goes on, every action you perform will become more and more powerful. If you make the best engine you will have a chance at victory.
It is quick and good fun and holds enough depth to interest gamers but it is simple enough (with very short rules) to appeal to families as well. You know, that sweet spot that can lead to huge sales as you appeal to a very wide audience.

The execution is a bit dry.

The marbles and dispenser aren't necessary, it works fine (more efficient/easy than cards or bag), but doesn't really improve the game by much. Make the game expensive.

788,Tall_Walt,9,"Fun, light engine-builder with marbles. Nice marbles, but the dispenser is maybe too cute for cardboard: a bag and a tray for just the six available marbles might have been a better choice.

Though in a way much like Splendor or Century: Spice Road, I find the engine-building much more satisfying in Gizmos.

The 2nd edition dispenser bottom still jams and reveals the 7th marble to players looking at it at a low angle in good light. I think marbles dropped in the back corners of the dispenser will not return to play quickly. I am using a bag instead. Table presence is nice, but so is a functional game."

I consider Century to be one of the best games of the last few years, and Gizmos has a similar feel.

Unlike Century, though, Gizmos has you building up a combo engine where you get bonuses each time you do an action.

814,Thrylos,6,Nice but nothing too much exciting and it takes a lot of space.
815,Thunkd,7,"'d never heard of this game, which looked rather like a gimmicky kid's game.

In the game you're trying to build machines (cards) which give you abilities and are worth points. The game ends when someone builds 16 machines (or some number close to that).

You build cards with marbles. The game comes with a contraption that holds marbles and feeds six or seven of them into a trough that are available to use. When one is removed, the next one slides down.

You have a couple of basic abilities at the start of the game. You can pick a marble from the trough. You can reserve a card from the central display (which lets you take a random marble from the marble contraption's hopper). You can build a card either from the central display or from your reserve. And you can look through a few cards from the deck of machines to try and find something you like (and either reserve or build it).

One neat thing about this game is that it's an engine builder. So you might add something that says when you build a machine you get to do a pick action. Or that when you pick a yellow marble you get to get a random marble as well. Or that when you build a black building you gain a point. If you can string a couple of those together you can end up with mega-turns where your initial action triggers four or five sub-actions. Late in the game you can have some powerful engines running.

The game was a lot of fun. And it feels like every game will spiral out a different way depending on what you're able to cobble together for your engine."

Gizmos has just a little bit more rules overhead, but much more avenues of strategy to play with, and personal satisfaction of an engine you built.

Had someone win a game of Gizmos by creating an engine that was purely designed to benefit from banking cards, and then building those cards, and getting benefits in both ways. Someone else might have an engine that's built off of searching the deck for cards to build. Or just creating a cascading waterfall of resources that rain down on you teach time you build something.

It's satisfying and pretty fun while being surprisingly quick to play. All that praise said, head-down engine-building games are really not my thing. I think they're a fun little puzzle, but they're not the kind of experience that draws me to board games. There's no interaction with other players.

Colours of gizmos are all the same. Plastic Dispenser doesn't work properly. Each Category of trigger has 1 or 2 outcomes at most across all gizmos.

853,VintageBullet,9,Such a fun engine building game and it's so easy to teach and play !  Must own for me and I don't see it leaving my collection.
854,vionemc,10,It keeps hitting the table. Everyone doesn't stand losing and the winner still enjoys the engine building.

861,Wanderer999,8,This is very likely a Potion Explosion cum Splendor killer!!
862,warlock000,7,"Fun, pure engine builder. A step-up in complexity from games like Splendor. It has enough interesting decisions to keep the advanced players involved while still being accessible for beginners. Just remember to keep the player count low, more people just introduce downtime (the pacing is still good, but I feel that the fourth player adds nothing to the game). Also, it's a bit heavy on iconography and it will take you a couple of moves to fully understand all the abilities (the icons add to the weight of the game). Still, it's a really solid product and a good pick for more casual gaming sessions."

865,Waylander1,7,A light and engaging engine builder.  The very tactile marble tray is a fun addition that makes the game better just by being there.
866,wedgeex,7.75,Checking at GenCon 2018 for this!
867,Wendyjo73,7,"Played once at game night. As everyone says, Splendor-like but with an added layer of depth. Really enjoyed and will probably purchase."
868,Wever1981,9,"Heerlijke engine builder; speelt snel weg, heeft leuke iconen, en - vooral - die kauwgombalmachine maakt 't echt AF. Absolute aanrader!"
869,whokan,N/A,Engine builder to research and add inventions to our labs powered by color matching energy balls from a 3D dispenser. Simple to teach with fast early turns that later become Rube Goldbergs of combo chains.
870,Wiegrief,N/A,Ken
871,Wigdogger,7,"A light-ish engine builder that leads towards some fun combinations and chains in the late game. The iconography is mostly straightforward, and you have to plan a couple of steps ahead to work out what others are doing and where you need to go. It's Splendor with slightly different theming and mechanisms, but the engine-building and combo-chaining feels fresher here.

It's not one I'd play all the time, but I do like that it plays quickly and smoothly."
872,william kohler,9,"A sort of splendor, where you build more and more your combo engine to gain marbles !!

William = 44/31

873,wilsonza,4,"A reasonably fun, light engine builder. However, it didn't really replace anything for me and I have a series of other go-to family weight games that my kids enjoy. I wouldn't turn it down if others wanted to play it, but can't see myself picking this up."
874,wisek,6.5,Played prototype. Nice engine building euro. Eurogamers should like it more.
875,wiz8mom,9,"Our favorite engine builder for now. Icon heavy but super easy to get the hang of. Simpler than Wingspan and Everdell, but with more triggering reactions."
876,wizpop,7.7,"I decent engine builder but feels like it would get rather samey over time, possible due mostly to the abstract nature. Still fun and would play again. I really like Roll for the Galaxy and would easily play that (a sort of similar game I feel) over this."
877,wolfthatwonders,N/A,"Looks like a neat engine building game but not much else. great colors, well produce would pick up for garage sale price. 10 bucks not going out of my way to get because to simple for most part."

879,WoogBlaine,8,This game is always fun and it's a neat little engine builder. Great game to teach and the marble dispenser is a gimmick that just works!
880,Wrightboy,8.5,"As of 2019 this is the best intro engine builder I've played yet. Fun marble gimmick, quick turns, and you always feel like you get to run your engine for a nice long while before the game ends. "
881,Wydolphins43,9,"Great game, really fun mechanics. A bit tough to teach to new people, but after just 1 play through you have a good idea on how to play."
882,xanatos78,N/A,In Italiano
883,XanderF,5,"Very interesting game, but...sort of maybe too much 'multiplayer solitaire', as there is no player interaction *at all*? Best you can manage is trying to identify some card or marble another player wants before they can pull it, but with the number of conversion actions available, and preciousness of actions GENERALLY, trying to disrupt another player's options in any way feels like a choice that is ruinous to yourself by at LEAST one order of magnitude, as you'll almost always benefit far more from actions directly benefitting yourslef.  Soooo much to *like* about it, but the lack of ability to react in any way to what someone else is doing feels...too great?"
884,XCinX,7,Won a copy from 'Beasts of War'
885,Xonim,7,"You start with just a single combo ability, but by the end of the game you might combo 6-8 (or more!) abilities together on a single action. It gets pretty crazy. Easy to teach but there's more depth and decision-making here than it may seem. I really like that they build the insert in a way that fits the marble tower without having to take it apart after each game."
886,xxIronGolemxx,9,A neat little engine building game with cool components.  The artwork on the cards is interesting and varied over the cards.
887,xyoxyo,7,"Pretty fast and fun combo card game.
I quite like this game more than Splendor even it shares some mechanism.

A little surprise for me to see that someone play this game in 75 minutes because my group finished this game in 15 minutes each time."
888,yendorii,6,It's ok but would be much better if it were twice as long.

890,yolandavi,6,Is there such a thing as too much engine building?
891,z10n x,7,"So far I'm not willing to crown this as the Splendor or Potion Explosion killer. I still like both the other games better, but that opinion might change in time."

893,z3m0g,9,Quite possibly our new favorite casual/family game.  Huge hit with everyone!
894,zachpas,7,played out
895,ZackStack,6,"This is a fun little combo building game with the added toy factor of a marble dispenser in the vein of Potion Explosion. The combos that started cropping up in the late game were a bit much for me to follow in my first game that makes me wonder if this would be a good family type game... but its certainly something I wouldn't say no to as a ""heavy filler"" at game night."
896,Zacrulo,8,Engine Building - Medium - 2-4
897,Zalasta,6,"The marble dispenser is eye catching but seemed to malfunction occasionally, where someone will inadvertently push too many through the hole, thereby messing up the display.  The actual engine building is decent, but could be slow going if you don't have enough converters to change the colors of your energy, because you definitely will not get what you want.  Research then archive seemed like to be a lot more efficient than taking directly from the card display.  It's a decent introductory engine builder, and the components are nice, but for me it's not very exciting to play, so it definitely goes to the growing pile of ""once is enough"" games."

899,Zatara_,3,Gimmicky themless multiplayer solitaire engine builder. Underwhelming to play to everyone I've introduced it to that has played a better engine builder as a frame of reference
900,zb1035,7.5,"Probably one of the best family games of 2018. A very light rules set makes this good for families if they can keep track of everything. The marbles are a cute gimmick. The key is to remember you’re trying to win, not just build cards. You can really play differently every time. A very solid game. "
901,zedeemia,7,Super clean engine-builder with a toy factor that's a bit of a gimmick but fun to play with.
902,Zedsdead,9,"Hm, I liked this better than I expected. The intuitive stacking system deftly mitigates the multi-trigger-tracking headaches common to engine building games.  And the fact that the marble dispenser tends to jam up is handled by the frequency of players pulling marbles from the hopper, which unjams it.

And you get a full game experience in 40min.  My early impression: 9 stars. We'll see how it shakes out after a few more plays."
