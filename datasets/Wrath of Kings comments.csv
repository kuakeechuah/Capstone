1,alexisW,9,"Excellent production of miniatures. Once assembled and painted, it's really a collection to behold.

Gameplay is another variant of warhammer/mordhiem type of miniature table top game.

The minis reminds me of confrontation metals. 

Rated for its minis. Rated 7 for its game play. "
2,Bard1790,10,"This is a really great skirmish game. Love the miniatures, the setting,  and the game system. Really sad that the game is not supported any more. It'll always be one of my favorites."
3,Bare2theBone,N/A,"have all factions, specialist #2 all factions, and big guy for all factions"
4,caffeineboy_1,10,"I'm blown away. I was, until the fulfillment of this Kickstarter, a diehard WarmaHordes player. I still love the game and have been playing it for over a decade, but I can see Wrath supplanting it.

The minis are uniformly beautiful, easy to assemble (in spite of what would be intolerably tiny connection points from any other manufacturer), mostly flash- and gap-free, and individually packaged so you never have to guess what arms/head/weapons go with what torso. I've assembled a skirmish-sized force of both Hadross and Shael Han in the time it took me to put together a single unit of Privateer Kriel Warriors. PP could learn a thing or two about restic *and* packaging from CMON.

The thing that's really won my heart though is the gameplay. I've played several games, lost as many as I've won, and had a great time doing it. The I-go-you-go turn system and reaction abilities keep you constantly involved in the game. The staggered deployment zones are an interesting way to differentiate models. Army building is dead simple. Specialists add a lot of fun abilities and tactical nuance. I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor and buy a starter box. You won't regret it. "
5,Chinkster,8.5,"Have all 5 factions and add-ons.

Gorgeous minis... very well made. Sure, there are a few duff minis, but overall, 90% satisfied. (If the Sedition Wars minis had been manufactured to this standard, I think the complaints would have been much less.)

Fun game play, and it gets quicker as you get familiar with the rules. But you need to play with the factions a lot to become familiar with unit capabilities and interactions and buffs.

Game: 8

Final rating : 8.5 (for excellent minis)."
6,Digclaw,9,"Quick to play, easy to learn

List building is simple, and the Moral system makes games go quick and still be fun.

The models are great. I think this is the first game to do Restic/PVC models right. The few mold lines there are, are fingernail cleanable. What ever formula they are using for their restic, I wish other companies had restic this good."
7,Dimoscis,N/A,Kickstarter Edition (Nasier & Hadross) with Emperor & Twilight Knight with tons of extras
8,djfooboo,N/A,Shael Han Starter Box
9,dustcrusher,8.5,"Simple rules that still allow for plenty of tactical applications. You'll have the game mechanics down in a few turns; it will take longer to really master the game. Multiple deployment zones and asymmetrical goals help keep things interesting. 

Confrontation fans will like the Goritsi faction- the sculptor of the werewolf units did some of the Wolfen, too."
10,FalleNct,N/A,Just rulebook so far
11,futhee,2,"My first and, quite possibly, last try at a miniatures game.  Demoed at GenCon."
12,Ghool,N/A,"PVC miniatures = blech.
Keeping an eye on it.

I didn't go in for a game pledge. I did like the minis, and went for the resin 5 figure collector set (1 model from each faction), and the Twilight Knight crossover mini.

I might pick up a few more singles if the ones I pledged for are nice enough."

21,helloo,7,"Wrath of Kings is a cool game that could be even cooler if it had more support (updating rules and cards to be consistent, correct, and to have clear cut explanations). But in general, it is playable and enjoyable"
22,jawmonkey,N/A,"Just received pledge. nice model sculpts. Very crisp and clean. cleanup and assembly should be a breeze. I haven't noticed much in the way of warpage or breaks. Rulebook is very nice, same with card art. I haven't had a chance to really go through and learn the game or study the individual unit mechanics so I can't speak for those aspects yet (and I may never as I got these mainly for painting and displaying).
Have Shael Han and Hadross armies, red bag of sleeved unit cards, and hardcover rulebook. I don't wargame as much anymore and I should probably move these along soon, models assembled but off their bases, stored carefully and with love."
23,JefferyB,8,"Joined the Kickstarter, got Goritsi and Hadross.  Great detailed miniatures!  Will most likely be using the miniatures for other skirmish rulesets."
