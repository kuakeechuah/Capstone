1,ajewo,8,"Deduction hidden movement game based on a TV series about smuggling cocaine form Columbia to the US. Four various factions try to chasing down Pablo (1 vs many).

[b]What makes it special?[/b]
* Unlike other hidden movement games, Pablo does not move often. Instead Pablo's actions give hints to the other factions about his hiding place. At the end of the round, Pablo spend money to move. The money determine how far he can move.
* Pablo has to be captured twice
* Other players (factions) get constantly information of the location of Pablo (the potential locations always gets smaller and smaller)

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Theme (mature, cocaine, smuggling, assassination)
+ Artwork (detailed characters, clear, clean, colorful)
+ Components (detailed miniatures, nice table presence)
+ Multiple victory conditions for Pablo. Objectives are assigned randomly each game (collect drugs or money) or become president (by securing Sicarios until the end of the round)
+ Sicarios have different range, glory, and armor ratings plus special abilities from cards
+ Pablo tries to grow cocaine for Sicarios to earn money (building farms) or to keep his Sicarios alives for glory points
+ Pablo tries to manage money for card play, moving Sicarios, and hiding himself
+ Pablo can place blockades to prevent movement (player interaction). The other players can do the same vice versa.
+ Turn order: Pablo is always after another faction's turn (can react)
+ Action / hand management: action cards are numbered from 1 to 4 which determine the power. Actions are limited each round, e.g., you can only try to capture Pablo two times per round. The Investigations Actions are the most powerful to locate Pablo but are also limited (strategical decision-making)
+ Different types of location (e.g., airports, farmland) and regions that help to pin-point the location of Pablo
+ 4 different factions. Each faction controls 2 characters and different abilities that can be used on another player's turn (cooperative)
+ Objective cards and Sicarios create variability (only 6 of 9 Sicarios are in play each game)
+ Hideout tokens are used to keep track where Pablo might be
+ Simple teach and play (Pablo player is more difficult and should be played by an experienced player)
+ Well written rules

[b]Neutrals:[/b]
# Language dependent (text on cards, objectives)
# Best with 2-3 players (too much downtime for the faction players with higher player counts)
# Some rules clarifications: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2256287/ultimate-cat-and-mouse

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Game should end at 3 rounds but may continue

Could have been a very fun game with a few tweaks.   All the ingredients are there - maybe a few too many - but needs balanced and streamlined.    

Or maybe I need more plays to get it."

15,DeadFrog,7,"Solid, difficult, 1 vs. all hidden movement game"
16,DECEBO,10,"I love hidden movement games and this one is great. Difference compared to other games in this genre is that the Patrón player actually does not move during his turns, but hides. Between his turns is he able to move. The hunting player has to derive from the position of the sicarios (Patrón’s helpers) where he might be. Those sicarios can hurt the hunters in different ways. Theme is very well present in this game; some downtime for each player, but for the Patrón player it could be interesting to listen to the consultations."

20,Ecredius,8,Only played a handful of times but have enjoyed every game. Tense as hunters or Pablo. Rulebook feels a bit incomplete and there is a lot for the Pablo player to remember
21,El_Pollo_Tender,9,"Narcos is an extremely tense game on both sides (Patrón and Factions). Playing as Patrón makes the player feel powerful, but they have to calculate their every move, as every single thing Patrón does gives information to the other players. The Factions players melt their brains looking for clues, planning their turns and feeling generally attacked every time one of Patrón's actions evidences his tight grip on the board. This gives them purpose, though; on our first play, I asked my friends if they wanted to play a season as Patrón so we could all experience both sides, but they said that after each Patrón turn they wanted to see me crash more than ever.

I strongly recommend putting a time limit on EVERY turn. We overanalyzed everything, and our game ended up being well over three hours long. Also, even if the game is for five players, we decided it would be best with two, as it becomes an engaging battle of wits. Three players is also fine, but more than that reults in extreme boredom, as each Faction activates only once per season, meaning that a player who already played on one season will have to wait up to eight turns to play again. The game offers an enormous amount of tabletalk between the Factions, however, so even if they already played during a season, they will not be left out. Some rules need clarification, but the creators have answered a few on the forums here, so visit them before you play.

Overall, it's a great, tense game with beautiful artwork and incredible component quality. This game begs to be replayed."

It's extremely thematic and very tense when you feel the Hunters closing in on you/you feel you're getting closer and closer to Pablo.

Only thing I dislike is that it feels as Pablo that you'll have to 100% focus on a Glory win or an Objective win, you cannot split focus."

34,greggre12288,6,"This hits some of the same notes as Star Wars Rebellion for me, but plays quicker [1-2 hours.] I prefer Narcos at 2 players, with one controlling all 4 Hunter factions. I love that the Hunters have to use precious action points to specifically guess the spot that Patron is hiding -- simply having a Hunter on the spot is not enough to reveal the hiding spot, unlike Rebellion. Love the Patron objectives, like shipping lots of drugs or getting a Sicario to an important meetup. Really felt like dodging a dragnet. The only downside is there is some element of time-consuming analysis the Hunters really have to do on their [very helpful] printed out player aid map, because Patron actions inevitably narrow the universe of where Patron can be.  Similarly, Patron needs to be careful not to give away too much new information when he deploys sicarios (more valuable sicarios must be placed closer to the hideout). I recommend the variant in the forums to adjust the win conditions to prevent Patreon from running out the clock. Dislike the fiddly special gang powers. Also, you kind of need the BGG variant: First: If Hunters cannot find Patron even one time by the end of Season 3, Patron wins. Second: If Patron cannot fulfill one of their victory conditions and win the game by the end of the 4th season, Patron loses. Otherwise, game will drag."

Seemed heavily imbalanced against Patron player at first play, but after second play more tactical options became evident. Maybe we've yet to discover hidden depths, but there do seem to be a lot of obvious choices. 

Not sure the fiddliness and bits and bobs really add all that much to the game. I suppose it's at the service of the theme, but as a game it's somewhat overwrought."

I don't think I will play this again, unless it is with a group that has played before and it can move along quickly.

Whilst there's lots for the Pablo Escobar/Patron player to do, at a full player count each of the hunter faction players will only  get one activation per season. The hunter roles aren't that complicated so this game is probably best at 2 or 3 players.

The rulebook leaves a lot to be desired so the game could benefit from a FAQ.

Definitely a thematic and gameplay improvement over letters to whitechapel."
