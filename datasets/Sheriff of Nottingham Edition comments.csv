1,antooki,8,"what an unexpected surprise. Game has lots of positive reviews, but Customs-the Game is better and much more fun than any review can convey.

quick, simple to teach and learn. Lots of ways to win and endless funny moments as you try to convince your family and friends that your giggling face is telling the truth. 

No idea what people are on about with the new edition, artwork is great"
2,BoardeciN,4,"I loved the premise of the original print, but this new print is so off-putting. The same coin and sheriff eyes on each card really takes away from the game. Its a shame they decided to go with such an elementary and anime-esque artwork."
3,ChildeRoland1919,N/A,"I will not be picking up this edition ... for me, the art/graphic direction is a negative. In the first edition I love the feeling of looking through a smokey cottage window at the wares on display. I could almost smell the fresh baked bread and aromatic pepper wafting through the air, while the beautiful silk bundle was just beyond my reach. The 'essence' of this feeling seems to have fled within the confines of the new graphic design which features wares on a solid white background and weird sheriff googly eyes,  thus killing the mood... in a game that is very much about mood."

7,quektis,N/A,"The artwork in the first edition looks amazing. Why change it? Such a shame they decided to make the art in this edition look so childish. From what I've read elsewhere, it looks like 99% of people agree with this. Not sure whether to pay a premium for the first edition with expansions or just put up with the off-putting artwork of the second edition"
