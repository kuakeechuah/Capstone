3,Al Capwnd You,9,"I get why Tom rated this so high - this game is action-packed and FUN. The miniatures are probably some of the best quality in terms of crispness of detail that CMoN has produced. Surpassing Zombicide: Invader easily. The miniatures have a slightly larger scale, closer to GW's heroic scale, that helps those details stand out a bit and are much less ""soft"" in details than the previous plastics.

Gameplay is straight-forward and frantic, and the maps look great. The game is difficult, even on the easiest setting. To be critical, it still shares some randomness and ""search for items and hope you get a good one"" that Zombicide also has, but tends to clamp down on search spamming by limiting the search areas to 3 searchable spots total per round.

Plays well at 2 and 3 player counts, not sure about solo mode or higher counts.

This has almost replaced Zombicide: Invader as it is quicker to play, feels less like a single wrong move will kill you instantly, and everyone is engaged at once."

There are things I had to devise just from my knowledge of game design, because there was no explicit rule written for it (in fact the rulebook leaned the broken way).  Specifically if you have a weapon and item with only locked slots is it one or infinite use.  The answer is single use- which should be obvious, but like I said the rules strongly imply the other way.

This and a few other things were lacking in the rulebook, however once we started playing it was very smooth and very fun.  Also the difficulty scales very well."

51,Grey Pilgrim,6,"Project Elite is a real time dice game that is lighter on rules than its peers, but also lighter on team play strategies. It focuses on fast, sequential die rolling--something that is thrilling but tricky to cooperate. Kickstarter excess aside, the base game exercises impressively thought out constraint for the better of the game. Monster types are similar but easy to tell apart at a glance; everything has a special power but is not cumbersome to manage; and players are posed with a wealth of options that are easy to discern through when on a running clock. There is a bit too much maintenance and phase order nuisance outside of the real time phase. More than anything, the Project Elite feels like a video game. For those looking for the game's style of play, this is enticing and approachable. Though, its theme is silly to say the least. Generic space marines fighting generic monsters under the guise of an adolescent's view on  what is cool masculinity. Project Elite is engaging to play during its two minute intervals, but the game doesn't offer many opportunities for team work while on the clock and presents itself as a niche title that could have dressed up as something much more vibrant and exciting."
52,gustav_henck,1,"Yes the bosses and Heroes are ugly in the first version. Which i Own.
But the soldier are miles better than this versus. How did you come the conclusion that every model should have toothpicks for legs in a game where you litterally throw the pieces of he board. 

Well. this is what happens when you let someone do a redeisgn who never played the game. 
Also great call on making all the sides except 1 of the die in the same colour so you cant distinguish your roll based solely on colour. 
Not to mention how you kept the uppgrade cards for weapons and yet somehow even manage to make that into a worse design. 

I'm just gonna continue play my old version with more than twice the stuff.

For 100 dollars plus 30 dollars shipping there is nothing in here to warrant that price. 
And don't give that it is lower shipping to sweden cause i have backed your games before and since you can charge whatever you want for shipping and clearly will why even bother posting fake shipping rates."

We played on a home grown baby mode and still got destroyed twice."
73,Kilerazn,7.5,"SOLO play:

Got this from Kickstarter couple days ago, learned it, and set it up today. 
Real time co-op game from CMON. You are soldiers stopping an alien invasion. Phases of the game: 
1.) Event card draw. Some are All Clears, some are objectives, some move the aliens and some change up the rules of the round. 
2.) Aliens spawn based on a card deck. Card will tell you what time, how many, which spawn point, and if they activate. You also draw from a Boss Spawn Deck. 8/20 cards from the boss deck are Boss stat cards. When you draw one, you spawn that boss. 
3.) Hero activation. Set a timer for 2 minutes, each hero gets 4 dice to roll, and you do as much as you can in those 2 minutes. Whenever you make a roll, if any show a red alien side, you have to move an alien. Other than that, you get to use any die sides or keep rerolling to move/search/shoot. You're trying to complete scenario objectives while keeping the aliens away from your base. For the first scenario you have to kill some nests that are near the alien spawn point and get back to your base, while still keeping the aliens away from it. 
4.) Alien activation. Every single alien does its ability if applicable, and then every single alien moves. 
5.) Clean up and check for win/loss conditions. 

So had a first try at it solo and it was not great at all. In a MP game each hero gets 4 dice each while in a solo game you control 2 characters with 5 hero dice TOTAL. This felt very constricting and I found myself really being able to use only one of the heroes in each round so I was pretty overwhelmed by the middle of the game. 

As it stands I probably won't play this solo again but will see how it plays multiplayer. It's also actually pretty fiddly when you have to start moving EACH alien, as they end up pushing one other and you end up having to spend the majority of your play just moving these aliens around."

107,Rob Riv,5,"The real time 2 minute phase is novel, but ultimately unfulfilling. Just leads to making a bunch of mental shortcuts in your mind to maximize movement/actions in the time allotted and, when managed well, leaves very little room for strategy and instead becomes a competition against yourself and probability to maximize repetition to completion.

It is sort of self defeating because ultimately, to be efficient, you don't want a lot of variety or complexity. So most weapons are very samey, if not inferior, or not worthwhile. Searching is also somewhat discouraged unless you can combine it with movement/attacking in the turn.

There's so much dice and token administering diluting your time, that the difficulty is mostly based around your ability to not stumble over yourself. On top of the token management of making sure the enemy figures follow their printed paths when you move them, there are also objectives thrown in - not necessarily to make the game more challenging so much as to give you *more* busy work so that the game isn't [i]TOO[/i] easy.

There is a flaw with the game's ethos. For example: under a time crunch, other aspects like weapons that hold your dice for the round, or taking damage and losing dice, when there are objectives that require [b][i]all four dice[/b][/i], end up seeming like a waste of time/effort. So much of the game gets lost if your primary goal is to achieve victory. Through the course of events, you are effectively forced to make a binary choice between playing to win... or to have fun.

Teamwork is also indirectly discouraged since, to manage your time well, you are focused on your own thing for those 2 minutes and cannot afford distractions. Since you control enemy movement, ""strategy"" becomes a sort of automaton mindlessness of either making them take the long way around to buy time or moving them towards you for easy execution. Not so much a puzzle as a disjunctive distraction.

Project: Elite is a weird kind of cooperative solitaire that felt more rote than fun; unless the idea of doing intense chores set to the theme/design of endless waves of alien mobs/hordes does something for your imagination. It fell flat for me, and after one game I felt like I ""got"" it and there was not really much more I needed/wanted to see."

It just works so amazingly as the chaos and unpredictability of the real time aspect perfectly simulates battle intensity better than any other mechanism ever could.

Playing this actually feels similar to a computer game, 3rd person shooter. So if your a fan of that genre this could be a great place to start your collection or round it out with some real time action. If you already like real time games then this is an absolute must own, if you hate real times games then you have no soul and this game is wasted on you, so look elsewhere.
