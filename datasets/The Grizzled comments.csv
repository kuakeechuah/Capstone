2,1984cjr,5,"I found The Grizzled quite intense and stressful, which I suppose I should have expected considering the theme.  We didn't have any fun playing the game - it was depressing and very difficult (which is probably the point of it all).  We played it through twice but on the third attempt we were feeling pretty miserable so packed it in and played Takenoko to lighten the mood and cheer us up.  I do absolutely love the artwork.  The beautiful illustrations fit the theme perfectly and the components and cards are all top quality."

5,2KittiesAreNotEnough,10,"So much fun! It has deep meanings about showing your vulnerabilities (hard knocks) cards at a good time, supporting each other through our traumas, beautiful and cool looking art work. War is shitty, and damn does it feel like war. Haven't played with the expansion yet but the game alone is amazing. Worth the money. I think it might be good to play with someone you know who has been through an actual war and let them know that you support them cuz just about everyone coming back from an actual has traumas just like in this game. Love it."

10,aaj94,8,"The Grizzled is a co-op game that's attempting to replicate the discouragement and camaraderie of trench life during WWI. Unfortunately, it replicates it a little too well -- this is just an incredibly difficult and depressing game. 

We played several rounds and didn't win any (after I dropped out they played three more) -- my father-in-law finally beat the game, but I think I'd find such a challenging game interesting only until I beat it.

Edit: holy cow, is this group-dependent. Played in a group dynamic that was much better and this is night and day from my previous experience! Bumping from a 4 to an 8!"

12,AaronM,5,"I was drawn in by the hype of this, but after playing it, the narrative is not there but something you have to make up. The difficulty of the game doesn't seem to be in the decisions you make, but in the brutal randomness of the draw.

I don't think the game is challenging, I think it's challenge is a mask for the brutal randomness of the deck."

19,AdamCarney,9.5,"The Grizzled affects players at a very deep level. The fact  that the artist, Tignous, was murdered by terrorists and has helped to craft a game that exposes the horrors of war is so significant. And the fact that these game creators put their own great-grandfathers and relatives who fought in WWI as playable characters is nothing less than incredible. "

23,adebisi,5,"The most notable achievement of The Grizzled is the total absence of one dominant player plaguing so many other co-operative boardgames. The rules state that you cannot discuss the content of your hand. It sure does make the game a lot harder for players to win, but if you do not mind a challenge, I reckon it only as a positive.

However, sometimes it felt that the game was even too hard. Threats accumulated so fast on the no man's land that we often witnessed a player withdrawing without even playing a single card. I not sure how fun is that if you do not get to contribute to the game in any way. Some people might find the role of a bystander totally satisfying but I felt sorry for the team. Some of the cards robbed you of free will as well, thus being very detrimental to the gaming experience. This might be thematic and needed for the balance, but a game should involve meaningful decisions instead of being a simulation.

What I have read of the World War One helped me in understanding the game. I was even able to visualise myself crouching in a trench in the most inhuman of conditions. It was also quite surprising to see how quick our group transformed from individual players to a team supporting each other without any trace of selfishness. 

The Grizzled is an experience. Personally I did not find the game and the decisions I had to make the most interesting, but the process itself was thought provoking."

It's a bit grim and not exactly a game you'd play at Christmas.  It gains for mood and originality, loses for being a bit random."

It's depiction of war as a nightmare to be survived, as opposed to a glorious adventure to be prized is really unique. And it's not just a framing device- it's baked into every single turn and decision you make. I can't praise the design enough. It's nothing short of art.

If it has any negatives it's that it's incredibly hard. I've played this half a dozen times now and haven't won once. Still this is one to own even if it doesn't hit the table that much."

44,Akado,5,"Not very uplifting.  Kinda neat, but didn't really interest me enough to own it.

There don't seem to be a lot of decisions that need to be made, so it's less appealing to me than other co-operative games, even at a lighter weight.

Oddly enough, this game is a lot more fun when you're losing, and it's very boring when you're winning."
45,akaisamurai001,8,"A unique game. In most hard Co-Op games that are hard, they constantly keep you stressed with a sense of hopelessness that makes you want to rise to the challenge. Grizzled is the only one for me that is constantly giving me a sense of hope. The theme of WW1 and the fact I know quite a bit about the history may steer the theme more strongly for me. But for example, if you all withdraw in a round with a lot of cards in hand, you all still succeed in the mission but maybe not well and thus makes the next missions harder. That being said, you still succeeded at something and if all are trying and know the rules, the game mostly ends with a possibility of victory (I lost in a game with 5 cards left to victory.). The gameplay is also easy to teach, play and finishes in a reasonable time.

Downside is some people just can't seem to not give away their hand and would flout the rules to get a win. 

Overall, heavily recommended, a thematic game with strategy and a lot of hope like what drove most WW1 soldiers through the war. "

Worst rule book I've encountered yet. Despite being a fairly light game the [lack of] rules make it seem much heavier than it should.

When beating co-ops I don't get a thrill of victory, rather an 'ah, ok we won.' And losses feel empty when no one gets to walk away with a victory - a feeling of wasted time, I suppose. A personal preference of genre rather than a slam to the game which seems well-balanced and made."

67,amacleod,8,"Something I don't think I've seen before: a push-your-luck cooperative! Nevertheless, it's a very good game due to the great difficulty in actually winning. Your decisions are based on trying to interpret why your fellow players have played the cards that they've chosen. This difficulty comes (in no small part) from the very restrictive communication rules, which (unfortunately) are very hard to enforce. Hanabi (a considerably better game) has the same ""enforceability"" problem, but it's not as much of an issue as in this game. Commissioned (better still) solves the problem completely, but only half the time, as player silence depends on a die roll in that game. Regardless, The Grizzled is a lot of fun and generates a lot of laughs, which brings me to a problem I have with the game...

...it's a lot of laughs. The Grizzled is much ballyhooed as a game which immerses you ""in the horrors of World War I"", the description I most frequently see. But the mechanics are so abstract that it could easily be re-themed as...anything! The art is good quality cartoonish art; but it left me with the feeling that the game was Asterix and Obelix meet Sgt. Rock. It's still a great game but it treats the theme far too lightly IF a publisher is going to promote it as an attempt to show gamers the horrors of war. I certainly felt not an inch closer to my great-uncle and grandfather who fought and were wounded on the Western Front. Perhaps if you could (like in Dr. Knizia's, Lord of the Rings) deliberately sacrifice your own life for your comrades, and if the art didn't portray a French group of Sgt. Schultz's, then the thematic idea might work better. 

If you want a better ""feel"" for the war, I would encourage you to play just about any old-school strategic-level wargame about the Great War. I clearly remember how grim it was after each turn in Guns of August to look at the dozens of counters you lost that turn, and thinking that each counter represented tens of thousands of men! The only thing that comes remotely close to that in The Grizzled is losing: you see the war-memorial card with the names of the player-characters engraved on it, and know that those characters are based on real world poilus."

72,Andr0ss,9.5,"I can't stop thinking about this game. The theme of friendship and love in the darkest of times, the subtle yet chilling theme of the horrors of war, the disturbing real history of the development possess say nothing of the War itself. The game is unlike any other and I'm fascinated by it. In any other game with the same theme ""surviving"" the War would mean something along the line of hit points or casualties, this makes it personal. In a lesser game ""moral"" would be a useless token that goes up and down on a track, in this its the point and meaning of the game. 

At Essen this year I got my copy signed by  Juan Rodriguez, one of the designers. He signed in my box lid ""May you and your friends find peace and happiness in this lifetime"" A game with a strong message like this is otherwise nonexistent. "

The Grizzled offered me a sense of getting hosed by unlucky card draws, with no way of averting that through clever play.  Indeed, The Grizzled actively limits my choices.  I want to support the comrade to my right but I can't because my supply tokens point the wrong way.  That's plain annoying.

Without knowing the contents of your partner's hand you must deduct what they hold and make the best decision for cardplay. The game is a cooperative puzzle that only gets better the more we play it. We've found that we have a bit more control with smaller numbers of players and I feel that we'll need to beat the game with a smaller playercount before ramping it up. Every game leaves me with the ""one more time"" feeling. This is a cooperative game that I truly enjoy playing."

It's clear that the cards can fall nicely or harshly and guesses for the Inspirational speech can be ....'inspired' or useless. It would appear that our 5 player game was lucky and inspired and we managed to survive.

There’s lots of stuff been written about how creating empathy is important in teaching history, but there’s only so many “imagine you are….” type activities you can run before they become tokenistic and miss the mark. With its focus on survival and camaraderie this might not give players a true feeling of “being there” – what can, after all? - but it manages to impart a little understanding of the complicated tensions that the soldiers experienced. I can’t know, but the collective despair, and sometimes anger, that is felt when one of your comrades plays a hard knock card that’s going to spell doom for everyone, and then the immediate turn around as everyone does their best to support that person anyway, seems kind of right. There’s this one kid who just seems to manage it every time. He’ll be sitting there, already muted by a hard knock card, unable to defend himself as he plays a “selfish” card, or reveals that now he just can’t face the gas anymore, and everyone rounds on him – “Dude!!! Are you serious” – but then collectively orchestrates the removal of his fear…. It’s a fantastic evocation of the better side of humanity showing through in the face of horror."

309,cfarrell,7,"The key to enjoying this game is to find the ""sweet spot"" in terms of what kind of communication and coordination to allow. The rules are intolerably vague and harken back to the original ""worst communication rules ever"" in Shadows over Camelot: you can talk but you can't tell people what you have in your hand. How on earth is that supposed to work? FWIW, here are some of the topics of conversation that we allow: ""can you currently play a card"", ""if I do X (remove a card, play a card type), does that leave you with a play?"", ""who do we think is most in need of support tokens"". Generally all topics relating to speeches are off-limits, and we don't allow direct questions about specific cards in-hand (i.e., ""do you have a shell card""). Also, once one player has withdrawn we no longer allow questions or discussion about support. Now, this is just a bunch of rules of thumb that work for our group, but I think you need to find a spot where the players can talk and coordinate without being able to directly find out what people have. If there is no ability for players to coordinate, the game is just random and boring. If you just play with open hands, there isn't enough here to be interesting. The interplayer dynamics need to work. The fact that the designer couldn't do this himself is obviously a major lapse and in a less fundamentally interesting game, it wouldn't be worth the bother to do the work that he should have done in the first place. But The Grizzled *is* interesting and unique, and pretty inexpensive, so if you can find a good spot I've found it a fun addition to the collection."

339,Chronnox,8,"My wife and I got into a cycle of playing the two player game after it had a few failed attempts in various game groups.  It distills coop into a simple push your luck, consisting of a decision of playing your cards to a shared central pool or to an individual pool, but adds complexity and emotion by making the gameplay non-verbal, and three support mechanisms via the Lucky Charm, Speeches, and the Support tokens.  Since every card play is painful on an individual and whole group level, helping your teammates with the scarce support mechanisms somehow is incredibly moving.  The theme is grim, the components are appropriately from a muted color palette, and the artist (Tignous) died in a terrorist attack in France, lending a sense of gravity to the whole game.  Not an every day player for sure, but really interesting with the right group."

347,ciggie,7,"I was pleasantly surprised by this co-op game and how tough it was with 4 players. We never came close to winning, but it was still a lot of fun trying to survive the war. You survive a mission by everyone withdrawing before there are 3 cards added of the same type added to the central display. However, if everyone withdraws too soon that will add more cards to the next round bringing you closer to losing so you still want to play as many cards as you can while avoiding a set of 3. It definitely seems incredibly hard in our 2 plays, but I look forward to more plays and may even look into the solo or 2-player rules to see if it is worth a pick up on that alone."

You could do a lot worse if you're in the market for a quick/cheap/portable game for a group of the sort of people who like co-ops; I enjoyed my playthrough and would like to try again. If the game falls down at any point it is a fault of over-ambition: it's aiming on some level to evoke the horrors of trench warfare and the simple heroism of the men just trying to get through it together, and the game just didn't seem mechanically capable of raising the emotional stakes to the level that would bring that to life for me."

Jugamos una cosa mal en el estreno que nos hizo perder todas las partidas. Las fichas de ""suport"" que se tienen en cuenta son sólo las de ese turno, no el conjunto de todas. De esta forma el prestar apoyo al compañero es más fácil que como nosotros lo hicimos (y aun así casi ganamos una vez :P) También considerábamos como un símbolo a tener en cuenta el símbolo de suerte de cada personaje, cuando en realidad, dicho símbolo no se tiene en cuenta para contar cuantos símbolos ser ven en mesa.

390,CtpUK,7,"A fantastic little co-operative game, that at it's current price of under £20 it's well worth a purchase.

The sheer stress brought on when a fellow player places a threat card into No Mans Land, and you have to somehow work out how to slowly clear your hand without failing the mission.  The fact that you are supposed to play with total secrecy as to what cards you have in your hand, and when deciding which support tiles to use, adds to the drama.

Not for the faint-hearted.  I will always tell new players that they should expect to lose, particularly when the Trap card mechanism is in use."

It's a polished system and very, very tight without room for error. Unfortunately for me errors are not avoidable as you simply cannot determine a real probability to what you should do to survive.

Sure, there are cards you can't play at times and cards you can, there are safe times to play them and bad times to play them, but you still have to make guesses and decisions on what to do and what everyone else could do, and this leads to a lot of tense moments wondering if you'll pass a given mission, or get through all the trials in time.

What a great little co-op. It bucks the trends of so many co-ops out there.

Players silently try to work through the Trials deck of cards together, trying to get to the Peace card.  However, the Trial deck is being continuously topped up from the Monument deck, so you have to work faster than the game.  A lovely, poignant game that can, depending on how the cards fall, be quite straightforward, or devilishly difficult.

Nice light co-op.  Unique and cute artwork and while the gameplay isn't very novel, it's entertaining and fun.

Despite being set during WWI, The Grizzled purposefully subverts expectations by focusing on the social relationships and mental fortitude of soldiers rather than the common tropes surrounding physical combat and territory control. The game is incredibly difficult, and imposes a pervasive sense of hopeless dread as treats compound and morale waivers, which immerses players in the bleak wartime atmosphere. The Grizzled also leans strongly on non-verbal communication so even the best of intentions can lead to adverse outcomes. It lacks variability, but achieves its goals with astonishing precision."

567,enzo622,6,"A cute game about WWI soldiers navigating the hazards of the battlefield together. The goal is to get dealt hazard cards, play them to the table without triggering a mission failure, and remove them from the deck. If you drain the deck entirely, you win. 

The choice you have each turn is that you may play a hazard card to the table or you may drop out of the round (but your cards in hand stay with you so…). If three of the same type get played, then that mission fails and you have to put those cards back in the deck. The trick here is that you're not supposed to communicate with one another about what cards you all have otherwise it’d be easier to coordinate who should/should not play which cards. 

I’ve yet really see if the game shines in this regard as our learning play was marred by rules confusion from the poorly written (translated?) rulebook. Fortunately, some people were able to instruct us on the intent of the rules as clarified in some second edition rulebook. But it made learning and playing such a simple game a lot more annoying than it had to be and colored my first impression of it. I saw enough that I liked that I’d certainly try again with someone who has all the ambiguities worked out."

571,epinema,7,"The Grizzled is a beautiful game with a coherent theme that achieves what it sets out to do.

Everything about the game is beautiful from the cartoon style (think Hergé's Tintin, to the atmosphere it creates and the cohesive way it brings your band of brothers together to overcome insurmountable obstacles.

Expect moments of tension, desperate plays and near misses as your group fight the uphill battle.  With all that said while this game is not overly difficult it does make you work for it.

If you draw a bad hand of, say, a lot of condition cards, and some of those condition cards happen to combo and make the game impossible to win... well, there's not much you can do about it. I only played one game, though, so I might have missed a few possible strategies.

Where this game is unique however is you decide how many cards you are going to draw each turn before more are added to the draw pile you have to go through, so you must carefully balance the risk Vs the reward. 
Since it is a card game it is very random and you can lose before you really begin, but it is really quick so just shuffle and go again. it would have been nice if the player characters were a bit different, but I do like the art style and the theme is pretty unique"

695,garoose,7,"Played only solo so far (with the expansion). Very difficult, very thematic (in an abstract way). Love the art."
696,GaryP,2,"""Oh no! There's two gas masks floating in the air! I sure hope a third one doesn't show up!""  

I really expected to love this one.  I read a bit about it, and almost bought it.  Thankfully, I had an opportunity to play it twice on two different days.  Simply put, not fun.  I am happy to play very difficult co-op games -- I *wanted* that -- but there still has to be some payoff, some story, something to make me enjoy the experience.  This had none.  I never felt like we were DOING anything, accomplishing anything. Even with Hanabi, which is a completely abstract numbers game that has NOTHING to do with its theme, we at least build stacks of cards that indicate SOME sense of progress.  That, coupled with too few interesting decisions, makes it not worth my time.  I'd play again if someone really wanted to, since it played fairly quickly, but I'll likely suggest something else instead."
697,Gateway81,8,Great game that really makes for a tough co-op. The art is amazing with a tragic story. A solid game that requires true teamwork to win.

700,gattz,6.5,"Interesting theme with unique artwork. I'm not sure I get the same vibe as the game and other reviewers promote though. It IS a difficult slog through bad situations, and you have to work together without direct communication. In a way, it's like a better, more difficult version of Hanabi. In terms of mechanisms, there isn't anything really exciting, but it's a quick filler. I like it, but it doesn't replace more extravagant co-ops where the crap piles up quick in any sense. "

703,Gaxia,7,WWI - the great war is very underused as a theme. Simple mechanics and fast playsthroughs makes for a (very difficult) fun little game.
704,Geegs,8,"Simple cooperative game set in WWI where players work together to overcome the threats posed in war.  A bit of a different take on a War game as there are no guns or bad guys to shoot, just you and your squadmates huddled together attempting to outlast the weather and other threats that come with war.  The game is difficult on your first playthroughs but you'll want to try again and again to finally get your first victory... on easy anyways.  "

711,GeorgW,4,"It's a simple and sedated coop that's a bit grindy and slow, but it's perfect for those tired evenings when you're not up for a bigger game. It's a bit boring to just count symbols and it's easy to miss the hard knocks and get confused about the neutral background.

It's too hard and samey for me to want to keep playing it, but maybe the expansion helps with this."
712,Germflinger,5,I like the theme and the art but for some reason can't really get into the mechanics of the game. Not a huge fan of co-op games in general so there is that as well.

716,gidorah,8,"The Grizzled isn't a game I'm ever dying to play but there's something very charming about the table talk. Everyone is just getting punished over and over again and you're so focused on making it through a battle without too much left in your hand. 

I don't know if I need to own it but I would rarely turn down a play."
717,giltleaf,3,Comparable to Hanabi in terms of the feeling they give me while playing but they are different design-wise - I've beaten this on the normal mode but never have I beaten Hanabi. They are both equally enjoyable experiences to me but Hanabi might have gotten over played so this is a fantastic way to spice it up. I think they are probably the same difficulty at normal mode but Grizzled can ratchet up more.

722,gixmo,7,"Components: not bad, the cards are a bit thin
Complex: easy
Weight: family game
Players: 3 or 4
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: cooperative
Decisions: enough for these games
Opinion: a group of friends are enrolled in the Great War, and you have to survive... but altogether. For doing so you have to survive several missions until the peace comes around and you have done all your tasks.
This means that in your turn you have to play cards into the mission, and there cannot be more than 3 menaces of the same kind there. You can also use your amulet to discard cards or give a talk to help your mates. Beside this, there are cards that are wounds, and could be really nasty.
In a nutshell, you have to decide when to play cards to the center, play a wound, use your amulet, give a talk or go back to the trench. The best part of all this is that you cannot talk about your cards, or who you will support at the end of the mission, avoiding one player to lead the group making it the typical cooperative game "

752,Greyxenocide,7.3,"Got a chance to play this (Finally) and man it is the most difficult co-op game I have ever played. The game oozes theme, but its not due to a mountain of text, or clunky systems. The struggle itself and the constant threat to your team mates and mission is where you really get the feeling that you're just trying to survive a horrible set of circumstances. The art is good too. This is a simple game that I'd be comfortable explaining to new gamers, but boy is it a challenge (we lost on easy mode). Can't wait to play again, and will probably pick it up to continue filling out my stable of micro-games. 

Got in a second play. Won this time. Still a neat, beautiful little coop game."
753,grim1234,9,"A very good coop game that is quite original with it's mechanics and is just quite fun. Doesn't overstay it's welcome, is easy to teach (well, kinda, cause nobody will have any idea how this game works unless they play it and then everything comes together in an instant) and despite having only one scenario and no player powers it's fun mechanically.

762,Gubirobi,9,"A dicsőség ösvényein avagy „Sajnálom! Tűz!”
Az egyelőre kis hazánkban beszerezhetetlen kooperatív játék témájával azonnal megnyerte szívemet. A Nagy Háború harcaiban, borzalmaiban folyamatosan őszülő barátok megpróbálják túlélni a mocskos lövészárokban, várva a megváltó békét (bár helyette sokszor a halál érkezik meg).
A játék nem könnyű (hello Ghost Stories és többiek), melyben külön kihívást jelent, hogy bár egy csapatban küzdünk, a rendelkezésre álló kártyáinkról, támogató lapkáinkról nem beszélhetünk a többieknek.
Egy játékban 2-5 fő feladata eljutni a békegalambig és felhasználni a kezükben lévő összes lapot. A lapokról csak annyit, hogy az 59 kártya közül csak egy jó van. A többi minimum kihívás, de inkább átok.
A küldetés elején lapokat kapunk kezünkbe (minimum egyet, de lehet több is), majd egy akciót végrehajtunk és következnek társaink, amíg az adott küldetést sikeresen végrehajtottuk vagy elbuktuk. A lapokon 6-féle fenyegetés található (valamikor több különböző is, plusz fincsi csapdák). Amennyiben 3 egyforma megjelenik a küldetésben, azt elbuktuk. Viszont minél több lap marad a kezünkben, annál többet kell következő alkalommal átpakolni a húzópaklinkra a morál paklinkból (de minimum hármat). Amint a morálpakli kifogy, a kis csapat veszített.
A lapok között találunk olyanokat is, amelyek csapást jelentenek a társaság részére és azt az adott szereplőhöz kell csatolni. Ha valakinek 4 értékű csapás kártya van a birtokában a támogató fázis után, a csapat szintén veszített.
Hogy ne csak rossz dolgok történjenek, minden karakternek van egyszeri jószerencséje (bér visszaszerezhető), amivel a küldetésben található egyik lapot el lehet dobni. Valamint az első küldetés után lehet lelkesítő beszédet tartania rendelkezésre álló jelzők erejéig, ami szintén hasznos.
Aki nem tud, vagy nem akar más akciót végrehajtani, marad a visszavonulás és felkészülés valaki támogatására támogató lapkák (kávé) képében. Ha sikerül valakinek több kávét adni, mint másoknak (egyenlőség nem számít), az megszabadulhat 2 csapásától vagy visszakapja jószerencséjét.
Majd a kis kávézgatás után a kezekben maradt kártyák számának függvényében csökkentjük a morálpaklit, egyben növeljük húzópaklinkat és egyre fáradó hétköznapi hőseink indulnak az újabb küldetésre.
Ha valamilyen csoda folytán bármikor megpillantjuk a várva-várt olajágat szaruképletében tartó biológiai repülőgépet (alias békegalamb) és nincs egyikünk kezében sem kártya, nyertünk.
Na ezt kihívás összehozni, azonban maga a játék egyszerű, gyors és nehéz.
Kipróbáláshoz ajánlom a játék BGG oldalán a fájlok között elérhető szabályösszefoglalót is. :)"

Yet it's only challenging in that you have to get pretty lucky or ""figure out the trick"". There is no real opportunity I could see for teamwork or clever play. In fact, communication between players is limited. This makes it ""more difficult"", but only in the sense that it allows the inherent randomness to adjudicate the outcome even further. Nice artwork.

The Mechanics made sense thematically, I was sure I was going to enjoy it and the decisions you make but alas, they all feel bad like when you make a speech and it does absolutely nothing to help your cause, because un-luckily no one has the the particular threat in their hand. Also when you look at your hand and the whole hand is hard knocks cards, this happens a lot actually more times than I would ever thought possible. The game ask you to be strategic, but you have no information to go off of, or complete randomness. you vote for support but even then its random because no one can have any idea what the other players are going to vote so its just a crap shoot if someone gets it. Even if you knew who someone was going to support, that information is not consistent because they may not even have the support token to do what they want. In conclusion, I experienced Lots of bad feeling moments, futile frustration, The game ask you to make a decision but then says but you have no information to guide your decision, do you choose heads or tails, now flip a coin. The people I play games with could probably get to the point where we could consistently win this game, but none of them have any interest in playing it again. Why would they, there is no part of the game that made them feel good about their choices. It's like shooting blindfolded at a target and if you accidentally hit the bulls eye the game says good job you win."

The problem is that the game is way too difficult and provides precious few moments of interesting decision-making. Most decisions are either made with nowhere near enough information to make a solid choice or so much information that the play (or lack of play) is obvious.

In war, it may be better to be lucky than good, but if that's the way a game is designed, it's not going to be an enjoyable experience."

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2015)

As it is a Cool Mini or Not game I wasn’t expecting much from it, however, I confess I had some fun playing it.

The Grizzled is a cooperative game set in the World War I environment. The theme is cool but I almost didn’t feel it through the game, only some of the hard knock cards convey it. The art is gorgeous.

The rules are very simple, you can explain them under 5 minutes. The gameplay is also very simple with mostly obvious decisions. The game is hard but it isn’t hard because the decisions are difficult to take. It is a hard game to beat because 1. You cannot communicate anything about your cards to your teammates  and 2. It has lots of uncontrollable luck (you have to make decisions without knowing the cards of your teammates, pure luck here). I like the part that you cannot communicate with anyone, this eliminates the “alpha player effect” most Co-Op games have.

On the good side the playtime is rather low (so I don’t mind much about the luck factor).

Bottom line, I would play again if requested, but it is a very light game for me, full of obvious decisions and lots of luck. It is definitively not a game for me. I will sold my copy of the game ASAP. The Grizzled is perhaps the best Cool Mini or Not Game I have ever played.

919,Jim Marshall,8,"Very impressed by my one play so far.

Regarding the gameplay, I usually avoid co-op games due their tendency to descend into the experienced alpha player basically telling everyone else what to do. I want to play a game, not just follow orders - why not just play it solo? However, there are a few simple rules in here limiting what information players can share that prevents that from happening, so kudos for that. This means that each player has to make their own decisions based on what they know of the game state.

The love in the theme and presentation shines through. The first group I tried to get to play backed away - a co-op game themed on a group of conscripts surviving the trenches of WW1 is a tough sell. However the second group was more amenable, and once they got into it really enjoyed it. It's a good game, but the presentation, support rules (through which the players have to help each other recover at the end of each mission) and the reasons why the designers created it (expressed in the notes at the start of the rulebook) somehow make it a more involving experience."

It's just really sad.  I don't generally get caught up in themes, but this one just really wears on you.  Add to that, it just seems impossible to do well with certain distribution of cards.

950,JohnnySchmaser,6.75,"The base game was enjoyable, but I felt the expansion added needless complexity. A well thought out design. I think the game is super difficult, maybe near impossible, like most coops are these days. The personality traits add some interesting dynamics and table talk. The speech tokens are cool too. Overall, feels thematic --a necessary ingredient in all coops, and the only real reason one would assume, people continue to play coops. 

For me, all coops I've played to date, feel like I'm playing a communal game of classic Solitaire, where your destiny has already been determined by the order of the cards. Everyone is simply going through the motions, hoping not to throw away the only opportunity to win, if and when it presents itself. An evolution on coops would be to have something like Freecell Solitaire, where 99% of the card order configurations are solvable. 

Ultimately, coops are activities, to borrow someone else's term, so you can't take the results of your efforts too seriously. The gods had a larger hand in your fate than you did.

959,JonBen,7,"[floatleft][ImageID=2595195][/floatleft]This is a fully cooperative card game with a WWI theme. Cards in the game usually have 2 of 6 different features. Three terrain features: night, snow, rain and three combat features: whistle, shell, gas mask. There are also hard knock cards which have no features and instead get assigned to a player and have various detrimental effects. 

A game is played over a variable number of rounds until either victory is won or defeat is suffered. The cards are split into two decks, the monument deck which if empty causes the players to lose, and the peace deck which if empty causes the players to win. Each round the players choose to  each draw 1 to 6 cards from the peace deck. At the end of the round if the peace deck is empty and the player's hands are empty they win the game. If not a number of cards are moved from the monument deck to the peace deck equal to the number of cards in player's hands, or 3 whichever is greater. This provides a wonderful uphill struggle for the players to fight against. They can choose to draw only 1 card each and have an easy round but that will not actually help them much in the long run. A lot of the fun in the game is managing this clock and deciding how risky to be.

[center][ImageID=2718713 medium][/center]

The actual game play in a given round is pretty straightforward. Players take turns, on your turn you have a few options but usually you play a card into the centre of the table. The centre of the table can hold at most 2 of each card feature. If a third feature shows up then that rounds ends immediately. Players are not allowed to communicate at all about which cards are in their hands. This part of the game is very light and luck based, but there are some strategic elements at play and fun decisions to be made. There is also slightly more going on in this phase that I haven't bothered explaining.

I really enjoyed the game, for a 20-30 minute game I think the level of luck is perfectly acceptable. There is often some post-game table talk as players are finally able to divulge which cards they had and why certain actions were taken. There are three difficulty levels in the game and you can easily create a more-or-less challenging game by moving cards between the two decks at the start of the game. The art is also very nice even if the theme and game play don't exactly mesh that well together.

Other than that, Les Poilus is an average cooperative game that can be hard on the players. The few actions don't leave enough room for clever moves as cooperative benchmarks as Pandemic offer in spades. There's just cards to get rid of, no spatial component. Exchanging information on cards is prohibited. Each group has to find a consent on allowed communication. Winning Les Poilus feels like solving a patience. Sometimes, this is what I'm looking for but as a game there are better cooperative games around.

The expansion probably wouldn't help my enjoyment as its main effect seems to turn up the frustration level."

985,Jumpman78,7.5,"A solid co-op that you will enjoy once you sort out some of the pesky little rules.  For instance, after the first game we figured out that we were doing support all wrong, that it wasn't about who had the most TOTAL support, it was about who got the most support THAT ROUND.

I really don't get it."
990,jvbren,7,"This is a co-op to the death. And yes, it usually is to the death. The problem is the team is hamstrung by the cards they receive. No matter how skilled they are, it is basically impossible to mitigate this significant hurdle. It really seems like *unless* you are dealt very specific cards at very specific times, you *will* lose. Having luck help you is one thing. Requiring luck to even have a chance is quite another. Despite this, the game can be tense and exciting."
991,jwallerrocks,5.5,"Unfortunately this didn't have the theme come through for me like I thought it would.  I didn't feel like I was running missions, it just felt like I was matching cards.

1003,Kalense,8,"This unique cooperative card game is a gem. The rules are very simple, though I have found it surprisingly difficult to teach. I think that the secret to getting the idea across is to start by explaining the flow of cards - the idea that they will flow from the Morale Reserve to the Trials pile, and from the Trials into our hands, and from our hands onto the table, and from the table to the discard pile. The rate at which they flow from Morale to Trials increases the more we fail to play cards from our hands onto the table. To play as many cards as possible in a round we have to try to anticipate what cards other players are holding, and try not to let hard knocks get in the way. And finally, each player in turn will have the opportunity to increase or decrease the flow of cards from the Trials pile into our hands - remembering that any cards left unplayed will cause the Morale pile to drop...

The Support cards are also quite hard to explain. For some reason it's not easy to accept that you depend on a process that random to get support from your comrades.

So far, however, everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it and wants to play again. And that's always a good sign.  "

Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive).

[u]Comments:[/u]
I had heard about this game when most people here on BGG heard about this game, when it was first published in Europe shortly after the Charlie Hebdo tragedy. The art was definitely evocative of that French comics style, which peaked my interest in what the game had to offer. When I heard the back story for the setting of the game I was really interested. Luckily I was able to snag a copy of this at GenCon this year and I have to say that this is much more than just a boardgame. Rarely do board game designers seek to expand the hobby into such design spaces, but the designers did here and they really and truly succeeded. The Grizzled is a game about war, but it is not a game about the glory of war, or great nations fighting for the future of the globe. Instead it is a game about friendship, loss, and the trauma of war. Each player plays as one of six famous friends who one night promised that they would all return home from the trenches of WWI alive and sane. The game simulates these friends in battle going on missions, and overcoming obstacles in a very abstract way. Through the gameplay you come to feel the terribleness of war, and its effect on all those who go through it. Players will be stricken with Hard Knock cards which will force the player to play a certain way in certain circumstances. All the way shelling and gas attacks and air raids are happening all around the friends. Players will give speeches to bolster their comrades, and sometimes a little luck will be just what you need to succeed in that final mission. Sometimes you will cheer, but soon the horrors of ware will catch back up with you and you will be climbing up that hill once again. I can not recommend this game enough to players who are willing and want to explore what game design could be.

1112,LazyRobot11,10,"A 10 may seem like a high rating for this type of game, but everything in this small French title just works so very well! The comrodery and passion of the players grows and evolves with the game, we groan together, curse at it together, and all cheer together when we manage to win. The trials faced in the game are a hallowed facsimile of the awful events of war and violence that serve to underline the theme of The Grizzled. This game brings people together under a banner of friendship, punctuated by a stark anti-war message. Half game, half art, all fun. All games should strive to have this amount of synergy between the mechanism and the theme.

I'm not a wargamer, and in fact I'm often very turned off by the almost pornographic affection many gamers have for real-war themes. The Grizzled's theme appeals to me both in how it's presented and how the gameplay goes. And I like the gameplay itself; a cooperative game that isn't more whack-a-mole or hidden traitor is always welcome.

1130,littlechandler,4,"Granted, I play this game solo only and I assume e.g. the supporting would make more sense with more players. Why does The Grizzled differ so much in rating from Samurai Spirit, when the former has much less of the swinginess and player elimination for portions of the game that the latter has? Well I do have to say the theme has a significant effect. WWI while not a theme I dislike doesn't have the underused theme aspect of Samurai Spirit, especially with how novel it is that you get to turn into animals. Also, I don't like the artwork of The Grizzled, and the weird phrasings on the cards kind of annoy me for some reason. There are also some logistical things: Samurai Spirit is one of the few non-party games that plays well with 7 whilst The Grizzled plays a more saturated player count (this actually is very significant), and the font of some of The Grizzled's cards are really hard to read, including some that I almost misread and only caught because my first interpretation didn't make sense.

Now on to the actual gameplay: I think in this game it is very abstracted you are just trying to avoid set collection, which makes the theme not come through very well. This is alleviated somewhat by the negative ability cards, but since you are trying to get rid of them, some of them are just parts of sets anyways, and they aren't the unique ability of someone, they don't feel very personal. Sure, Samurai Spirit's kiai track is pretty abstract too, but I would say the round end penalties already are as thematic as the negative ability cards of The Grizzled (The Grizzled has more variety but Samurai Spirit's makes more sense why it is happening), notwithstanding character abilities that are more interesting than just get rid of one card with a matching icon, and the addition of kiai abilities.

I know supporting would probably work better with more people playing, but I don't really understand the point of it. Sure, there's some tile management of not being able to support, but it feels like just a mechanism tacked onto the game to try to make the game's puzzle more challenging rather than something that actually made the gameplay better. In contrast, you only support very rarely in Samurai Spirit, but doing so feels like you are really changing up the game.

I don't like the lack of sense of progression in this game. I guess this aspect is in fact thematic that you are stuck in a quagmire, but it is frustrating how slowly you whittle down the deck sometimes.

One thing this game does do quite well is needing to hand manage well, and puzzling out who should play what, what should be left for future rounds, how many cards to draw per player per round, and when to use your single use tokens. In this regard I think it does a lot better than Samurai Spirit: you won't feel like you lost just because you got unlucky, and there is more strategy despite both having to manage the wellbeing of all its members and also the no man's land/rest of the raiders deck and striking the right balance. However, I think the risk-reward aspect of should I draw in Samurai Spirit while not as mechanically sound adds more tension to the game, whereas here it is mostly just an optimization puzzle."

Also to help players the previous mission leader (this will go clockwise each turn) gets a speach token which can be used to pick a symbol/enviroment and all plays may kill a card from their hand if it matches.

I could never get this played because of the push-your-luck element and the fact that it's a co-op game where you can't talk strategy with the other players or show them your hand.

Somehow, through an equal mix of evocative artwork and moving mechanics -- a phrase I don't think I've ever used before -- The Grizzled manages to evoke the hopeless, faceless futility and horror of trench warfare in play. It's frankly amazing, especially given its small footprint.

For example: You can only provide support to your comrades, even if you're the person who needs it the most. You can acquire a card that forces you to support yourself, but it's an affliction. So simple, but so moving -- and so beautifully executed.

Each turn forces all players to risk the entire group as they work from their own secret hand of trials so every player is taking the same risk, with the same limited info, the same consequences.  This totally levels the playing field and forces players to work [i]together[/i] rather than just toward the same goal.  All player's actions matter, but all players also have to step up as a result with no real room or ability for quarterbacking.  It shares that commonality with games like Hanbi, The Mind, and Beyond Baker Street, but adds an element of push your luck that reminds players they will fail sometimes... but thats ok.

The gameplay is simple, but requires a high degree of cooperation to survive. Sometimes you die unluckily, but that's okay because of the low time investment each game."

1358,Mutiemoe,7,I tried this game out after reading Bruno Faidutti's touching eulogy on Tignous.
1359,muzfish4,8,"The Grizzled is a quick play co-op game set in the Great War. The basic idea is that the players are all friends from the same little French town who enlist and have their illusions of victory and glory shattered to the point where all they want to do is survive the war. In ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ to enemy is rarely seen, the real struggle being one to survive a very dangerous place as a part of a system which seems utterly indifferent to their wellbeing. The situation is similar in The Grizzled in that the Germans are never seen other than indirectly through gas or artillery fire (though this could just as easily be misdirected Entante ordnance).

As the game progresses the friend incur various mental scars, phobias and suchlike, until the weight of it all is too much for them. These can be mitigated by support from their friends but there is only so much that camaraderie can do in the face of such horror. The two outcomes are that the friends survive the war and return home or that they will join the voluminous role of honour as part of this lost generation. 

I played The Grizzled with five, which I am told is nearly impossible, and we all fell victim to the war thrice with no real hope of survival. I enjoyed the challenging gameplay and really appreciated the theme. This is a very well-produced game with excellent artwork and top-notch production values. I enjoyed and appreciated the games and this is one I will look out for a future purchase.

Two other favourable points are that the game box is small and won’t eat up shelf space and that the rulebook also comes with a ‘justification’ for making a game with this theme. This game is so well executed that it could be used as an educational tool for high school students to help understand the effect of trench warfare on those who lived it. "

Interestingly, this small, abstract game makes me think about the senselessness of war and violence in a way that the other games don't. First of all, the art is wonderful and created by Bernard Varlhac who was brutally murdered in the Islamist terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo.  it's hard not to think about that when you first open up the box.  

Then there is the theme itself.  Players are soldiers, friends really, trying to survive the horrors of WWI trench warfare. Players can provide support to each other to help them overcome hardships and even deliver speeches to help rally and bolster the troops. Victory leads to peace represented by a dove flying over a devestated landscape. Defeat leads to the name of your character on a post war memorial to the dead. Poignant."

Great abstract game about friendship.
No, this is not a war game.

Very easy to learn the rules and short play time if playing scenarios in the campaign.
Even if you are not allowed to know that much about the other players cards there is still a great amount of interaction and planning amongst players.
In my opinion The Grizzled is best at 3 players, espescially when giving support. In a 4 player game everything becomes more complicated and while some may consider that a good thing others will not.
Same thing with the scenarios in the campaign. The first 3 chapters are both easy to play and challanging, while those chapters to follow greatly step up in complexity adding recruits and traps.

Pros:
•Easy to learn.
•Fun to play.
•Short play time for each scenario.
•Conclusion card for each scenario estimates play time for next chapter. Fine service, i think.
•Clever design not to end game session if an unsuccessfull mission, but instead let the situation become more difficult and let the game continue.
•Cards may be mixed in any order creating customized difficulties and playability. All cards are numbered for easy resets of the decks.
•Nice components and minis.

Cons:
•Dystopic setting for the theme.
•May become repetetive (as war does irl).
•Sometimes (often at 4 players) the only real option for a players first action on a mission will be to withdraw. Although this is a part of the hopeless group situation that is the games theme it may not be that fun for the player.

Anyhow, The Grizzled is a little gem and earn its place in the main collection. Coop, easy set up, fun to play and short play time. Whats not to like?"

1421,NowOrNever88,3,I don't like the luck of the card draw and in the traps. We were 1 away from beating the game. I also don't like 2p's ghost player and the random support tile location. I prefer Hanabi for a hand card co op. I also didn't like the limited communication. I did however like the art and theme (brothers in arms in the thick of war - the theme is actually pretty touching imo but I'm not a gamer who desperately needs good/certain themes and such) but the cards can be hard to track how many symbols are out there as I got mixed up at least once and put 3 symbols by accident.

1444,oninoyakamo,6,"For some reason The Grizzled is so difficult to teach! The basic idea is simple, but almost all the actions require rehearsal with new players.

It starts with the idea that withdrawing from combat is considered a success. From there, getting new players to understand where to send their Relief tokens is problematic.

I like the game, but I don't have the patience every time I need to induct a new player, so a trading it will go."

You play the cards you get, hope that the cards amongst the group are diverse enough to get as many out as possible, and choose the appropriate moment to withdraw so that any misery burdens you have are negated for the rest of the round. And either come up with a protocol at the end of each round as to how to pass tokens so as to remove a misery burden, or throw up some prayers that everyone's thinking along similar lines.

What I like:
- Some clever mechanisms
- Plays pretty quickly (15-30 minutes with 5p)
- The war is a setting, but there is no killing or gore. I would put the weight around 1.8, on the assumption there is hidden depth in card counting and carefully analyzing every choice everyone else makes. 

What I don't like:
- Not being allowed to communicate
- Seemingly brutal difficult (at ""normal"" level)
- Constantly being placed in a situation where all your options are terrible
- It seems to snowball when you start to lose

If this weren't cooperative, I would probably rate it a 2. It's one I'll play if someone else really wants to, but it would be somewhat reluctantly."

1504,Phrim,5,"The Grizzled is a cooperative card game about surviving trench warfare during World War I.  I was surprised by this one--despite the seemingly interesting and immersive theme, the game was remarkably... abstract.  Players played cards that affected either the outside environment (by adding one or more symbols) or played ""hard knocks"" cards on themselves, which sometimes add icons and sometimes give you negative text.  If three of the same icon ever show up, the team loses.  Players can decide when they want to withdraw from the round (presumably if they'd be forced to play a losing card), but the more cards they can get play, the closer to winning they get.  I'm not really a fan of cooperative games, but I was expecting something more than a symbol-matching exercise here.

1550,prismofeverything,8.2,"A true work of art. This is a game that shows you how games can also be art.

The inversion of the usual idea of a war game. Usually in wargames you command armies and wage war over terrain and great distances, and you outmaneuver and outsmart and outfire the other general or vice versa. It is about supply lines and dice modifiers and the glory of blowing the enemy away.

In the grizzled it is the total opposite. You are a poor frightened person in a trench, whose sole defense against fate is hope. Hope which wears very thin while shivering in the cold and rain and snow, hearing shells rain down from the sky which you are powerless to avoid. Waiting silently for that moment when everything goes blank. Protecting that small flickering flame of your spirit from winking out entirely. And the only consolation: your companions, who are just as miserable and terrified and helpless as you are.

You help each other. And in this game, when we are dead, I actually feel camaraderie with my fellow soldiers. The kind of bond that only mutual suffering can forge. And the glow of this game lasts long after we are done. The art of this game is on its psychological effect, and in being a form of communication from these long lost brothers in the trenches who are no longer here to tell the story. I salute you."

1569,quietcorn,7,"This is a really fantastic co-op game where players try to make it through World War 1 alive. It's a game where you take a deck of hardship cards, and cut 20 of them and put them on top of the win card, which represents peace. Thereby making peace something that you can see off in the distance. Then players get a number of cards to their hands, and have to play the cards one at a time to the center of the table. If a third copy of any of the six threats gets played, the players lose, and the cards that were played to the table go back on top of the peace card pile. If players pass out before that happens, then they make progress. The cards in the center go away, but then you add new cards from the remainder pile on top of the peace pile equal to the cards remaining in player's hands to a min of three. If the remainder deck runs out, it reveals a monument with the players names on it indicating they died in the war. If that wasn't enough, players also can get traumatized by hard knocks cards that force them to play or act erratically if they aren't gotten rid of quickly. The art is gorgeous, and the box and playtime is small. The game is really hard with 5 and easiest with 3 players.

Once you figure out what you're supposed to do, this game was a real gem. It has just enough thematic flavour and aesthetic to evoke the horrors of war, as there is always a sense of dread while playing. Each mechanic does feel like it has a place and you get a great sense of camaraderie at the table. There is something really poignant about the win condition of seeing the peace card and it feels more satisfying than other cooperative games as a result. Would really recommend."

The expansion is great.  It's almost a ""must"" - I certainly won't play without the expansion anymore.

The solo variant is pretty good.  It reminds me of Friday in it's difficulty (obviously the games are much different).

I truly ha ed Hanabi the first few times I played but after trying enough of these (and I count Onirim) I've decided that Hanabi at least doesn't claim to be more than it is.

Also, the communication rules are vague and problematic -- a serious oversight in a coop game.

I really liked how traumas worked.  They offered short vs. long-term trade-offs, they were very thematic, and the fact that phobias go away when you retreat added tactical decisions that were sometimes quite interesting.  I wanted more stuff like that, and less icon matching and random card flipping."

Pros: challenging cooperative play.unique gameplay mechanisms and game design. Very nice and unique artwork and production quality. Very small amount of tablespace required. Deep and captivating theme and gameplay.

However, you can't [i]just[/i] play your hand. You have to be very aware of what the other players are doing.

The only reasonable conclusion we made from the rules is that you can't _explicitly discuss_ whom we as a group _could_ support, with the tiles we have available. So we played with the house rule: mission leader will reveal his opinion who we could support this time, before the first player withdraws, but there is no further discussion.

Otherwise... cool artwork, but boy what a messy rulebook. Even on my 5th game, I was still constantly searching for stuff. It's not a bad game, it wasn't even boring (what I'd say about 90% of co-ops), but everyone among my friends and family hated it for the unclarity and unintuitiveness. So... I'm selling."

1709,schkff,7,"Tried this with friends after a long day at UK Games Expo, which I wouldn't be crass enough to suggest went some way towards emulating a degree of war-weariness... Didn't get the rules right, but it was also hard to know what we should do cooperatively, bearing in mind what the rules forbid discussing - wasn't clear to us how the game is supposed to be played. 

Hope to try again under more auspicious circumstances.

Art and production are flawless, I'm hoping that there is a real game in there that isn't too limited by having to play in the right spirit.

Edit after finally getting my head round the rules thru solo play : there is a real game here, maybe with much determined by chance and an inevitable attrition - but it does work. Of particular merit (once understood!) is the way that communication restrictions limit the potential for Alpha playing, and the simplicity of the game lends itself well to a group getting into the same mindset - and so (hopefully) having a chance to win."

You have to read your comrades' plays to get a hint of what might be in their hand.

I had very high hopes for this one. The theme and presentation are very appealing to me. The game is very hard to win. I guess that is the point, but I'm not really sure how to mitigate the luck of the cards yet. I'm not sure if the strategy is really subtle, or if it just isn't there. I think it's in part based on the group dynamics, which in my personal case may inhibit my enjoyment as I don't have the consistent game group that this game may require. In this way it is similar to Hanabi, a game that shines with a dedicated group that I love more in theory than in practice.

1793,smilingra,8.5,"An addictive co-operative that is quite challenging. It is certainly challenging to get rid of cards, as it seems that nearly all cards seem to jeopardize losing the mission after just the first one or two that are played. As a result, you are really facing tense decisions almost immediately every round, and the struggle to survive is palpable. What I really like is that since everyone is looking only at their hands and table talk is not really allowed, each player is making educated guesses to help the overall cause. Effective timing of what little resources are at your disposal combined with some luck is necessary to win. The WWI theme is lightly there and does add a little flavor to the game. After a couple of plays, we've mastered the Rookie level, but I think the Normal level is going to keep us challenged for a long time to come."

*Traded away."
1798,SniperDan84,8.7,"Components - 1/1 Cards are good. Box is compact but nicely made. The rules are clear and straight-forward. The few cardboard tokens are nice and thick. 

Fun - .9/1 It's a quick playing enjoyable experience for 2-5 players. I've not met anyone who didn't have fun with the game. It's only drawback is the difficulty gets to people after several plays. You lose far more often than you win, and you can get so close to winning so many times yet manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Replayability - .7/1 Generally speaking there is 60 cards with 2 major types of cards (threats versus hard knocks). Depending on the ratio these two types show up drives the biggest unfolding of the gameplay. This means there is a fair amount of replayability. Given the short nature of the game we generally play 2-4 games in a row then move on to something different. We play frequently though so we've definitely gotten our money out of the game. 

Strategic - .7/1 
For only a few choices to make as a player there is quite a lot of power over the outcome. That being said, the game still does have some dependency on the luck of the shuffle. If threats are concentrated such that everyone has the same ones there is nothing you can do. You generally have to pay attention to what cards people are playing. Sometimes you actually want to fail a mission to help get rid of an additional card (or ensure someone gets the support token). This games finds a really good balance of depth for a simple & easy to learn game. 

Theme - .9/1 I think the theme in this game is powerful. The Great War was one that some nine million combat personnel never made it home from. The unique perspective of this game is that you aren't really focusing on combat. You're not trying to kill anyone, you're just trying to keep your brother in arms from succumbing to the many horrific faces found in this particular global conflict. You find yourself trying to constantly avoid letting anyone get too buried. When I play those elements come through the theme for me. 


Personal Rating - 4.5/5 This is a great co-op that can be taught very quickly, and takes a fair amount of time to master. I love that there's meat here even though the game plays very quickly. It makes for a great experience when you want a meaningful strategic game but just don't have the time to play an hour plus deep game."

1801,SnowDragonka,10,"I love this game, it's a pretty tough coop. The theming is from WW1, but it's pretty abstracted, so you don't feel depressed, although if you think about it, it's a pretty dark theme and what you encounter is also very depressing. All the effects on the psychology of the people, them having a threshold of what they can endure and one more is just too much for them to do it. The morale constantly going down. The only thing keeping you going are your comrades in action who deal with the same stuff. It's tough.

The game itself plays smoothly, but it's a pretty difficult coop. You have to weigh risk and possible gain all the time, because there's only so much time before your morale drops to 0 and you just give up, no more will to survive, you just die. And what's worse, you can sometimes almost see the peace symbol appearing and boom, last straw, you won't make it.

On the other hand if you win, it feels good. And if you don't think about the theme as much, it's very enjoyable quick coop that still manages to have a lot to offer. I love this game. Played 2-3, worked great."

1803,soccastar001,6,"This is a cooperative card game set in World War I.  One of the main selling points I've seen for this game is that players are not allowed to communicate with each other.  While in theory that sounds neat, needing to work together without being able to openly communicate what you need, it isn't so much a neat feature of the game as it is a needed rule for the game even to work.

The game is played by players each drawing a certain number of cards each turn to completely work through a deck.  These cards mostly have symbols and backgrounds on them, collecting 3 in one round fails the mission, there are also cards called hard knocks that cause negative traits that you can draw.  For the most part you can choose to stop playing cards at any time, which you want to do if playing a card causes you to fail a mission (unless a hard knock forces you to).  However more cards are added to the deck you are trying to work through equal to the number of unplayed cards at the end of a round.

The reason the ""no communication"" thing doesn't feel so much like a neat feature as an obligatory rule is if I could talk I would just tell my teammates what cards not to play so we could get through more.  The only way this ruleset works is if you disallow that kind of communication.  And past this gimmick that's not really a gimmick there's nothing that interesting here.  It is really just a card-based coop game where we are trying not to match too many symbols.  Some of the hard knocks cards do spice it up a little bit and it's not a bad game.  Just kind of plain considering how much good coop stuff there is out there.

This might be intriguing if you like the art style or theme/setting but neither of those really appeal to me either."

So it nails evoking that fear and desire for self-preservation conflicting with comradery and solidarity.  When successful, the elation is all the more powerful.

I don't find the theme particularly well-represented (the support mechanism in particular is annoying -- you can't help the guy next to you because your only tokens go in the wrong direction?) and my first impression was that luck had unduly significant impact; I now suspect that it felt that way due to extremely poor play.

1883,Synthezoid,9,"A game that's hard to play just once. A case of theme making mechanics sensible and palatable, and great fun. Some co-ops are all about solving the mechanical puzzles they present (like Pandemic), while others are about limited interactions or relying on your friends (Hanabi). This has elements of both which make it tense and constantly unpredictable. Even if it is at times unwinnable, I think that only feels right. The short playtime means it doesn't suffer for it, either.
This is different from my other highly rated games in that it's both simpler and luckier than I tend to love, but all bets are off in a co-op game, and being so short and light helps too. I think the things that would make this fail as a competitive strategy game contribute to its brilliance as a cooperative one.
The solo mode provided with the expansion is nice to have, I guess? But I quickly realized it's too easy."

It took a while to wrap our heads around the rules, but the game play was decent enough and actually fit the WWI theme reasonably well.  The most interesting aspect are the trauma cards (I might have that name wrong) that give you semi-permanent negative effects.  It felt appropriate for soldiers being driven insane by war.

Its tense, as it should be.  I love Pandemic, but I love how this differs from Pandemic in that you are playing together but have to make decisions on your own for the good of the group.

The art was actually provided by a French political cartoonist, shortly before he was killed in the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo.

Mechanically, the game is fairly workmanlike.  But these simple mechanics efficiently express some difficult concepts regarding war: experiencing trauma, personal sacrifice, the toll of living within such horrors, but, mostly, the brotherhood that developed among those who lived within such horrors together.  

Heavy stuff for a simple card game.  I'm impressed by games that strive to make a statement, and I'm impressed by this one.  However, it's not one I think would have a lot of replay value; my rating is reflective of that."

In The Grizzled the players are playing cards to a central area. Each card has multiple symbols/threats on it, and you're trying not to match threats that are already in play. The catch is that you can't talk about the cards in your hand. 

The difficulty seems really high. I have won a couple of times on easy mode, but when you step up to normal difficulty it seems like it would be almost impossible to win (but I admittedly have little experience on normal mode so far).

This brings me to my one concern with the game. I'm not sure how much your actions actually influence whether you win or lose. Even if you play as strategically as possible, bad card draws can be almost impossible to overcome. I suppose this isn't too different from most co-ops, though.

Overall this is a fun game that plays quickly and seems to work well with 3-5 players."

1939,TheCrippledWerewolf,7.5,"Simple coop game with high difficulty and great thematic elevation, even with 3 players. Must be played ""in the spirit"" of the game, so for people who don't like staying silent about their hand it's a definite no-go. But, just like Hanabi, even though you aren't supposed to speak directly about cards in hands, there is still a lot of table-talk and planning. Love the leaders, the speeches, the tension, and the hard knocks with text that affects every single loophole in the game. 

I like trying to deduce what cards other players ""aren't playing"" and using Speeches strategically. I don't like that the game can get locked into a death spiral or that you can ""know you can't win"" and have to concede. It's also very very swingy depending on card draws. We won out first game, and LOOOOOSSSSTTT the next. And it is basically unwinnable in many cases if a player happens to randomly draw a ton of hard knocks. Support tiles are super integral to success, but they are, sadly, the least fun aspect. Luckily, it plays fast, so you tend to play twice in a row every time."

1968,Thunkd,5,"The Grizzled is a quick co-op game set in World War I. There are two piles of cards. One pile (the peace pile) you want to deplete as that is the way you win the game. The other pile (the war memorial pile) you don't want to deplete as that's a way to lose the game.

Every turn the new start player says how many cards each player will draw from the peace pile. Then players take turns either playing a card, withdrawing, using a special ""charm"" ability or giving a speech. Playing a card either means putting one of the cards from your hand into the common tableau or in front of you (if it's a ""hard knocks"" card). The cards in the common tableau will have a type of weather/condition (like snow, rain and night) and an object (like bullets, gas masks and whistles). If you ever have three of a type out, you fail the mission (which has some penalties). Some of the cards have nasty stuff on them, like multiple items, multiple conditions, or ""draw and play a random card from the peace pile"". The hard knocks cards go in front of the player playing them and have some detrimental effect on the game. If a player ever gets 4 hard knocks cards, you lose the game.

The charm ability, which you can use once per game, lets you dispose of a card from the common tableau if it matches you special criteria (like being snow, for example). Giving a speech lets all other players discard a card from their hand if they have the type you call out. Withdrawing means you no longer play cards, and you put a support token out, which will either go to the player to the left or right of you. If one player gets a majority of support, they can discard two hard knocks cards.

After everyone withdraws for a turn, you count the number of cards players have in hand and draw that many cards from the war memorial pile and add them to the peace pile. Additionally there may be hard knocks cards that cause extra cards to come out as well. The struggle in the game is that you want to pull more cards from the peace pile, but if you do that means you'll likely not be able to play all of them and will get more cards added to your peace pile.

I like the art of the game a lot. It reminds me of a sunday morning comic strip from when I was a kid more than anything else. The idea of the game is interesting, but the thing I don't like is that the game does what a lot of co-ops do to try and make the game a challenge. It just makes the game insanely hard and throws randomness in to try and trip you up. In our first game we almost immediately self-destructed, just because of bad card luck. You're only going to win this game if you get lucky and the cards come out in the right way. Sure, if you play badly you can make things worse, but even if you play perfectly, you're at the whim of fate. That doesn't make a good experience for me. I do like that it is essentially a co-op in a filler length... but I end up wanting to like this game more than I actually do. "
1969,tiagoVIP,7.5,"About [thing=171668][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=171668][/thing] is a cooperative game set in the World War I, in which a group of friends fight together to survive the hardships - both personal and regarding the overall threats of war. 

Don't worry too much, though. [thing=171668][/thing] is mostly abstract, involving just card play, in a quick and intense game that lasts around 25 minutes. It can start talks about war and the men that fought it, but surely it doesn't contain nor represents the horrors of a war.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There are two decks of card: the Trials and the Morale. Cards from the Trials deck are given to players. Every complete round is a Mission. During a Mission the player can do, each turn, one of the following:
- Play a card;
- Withdraw and give support;
- Use a Lucky Charm;
- Give a Speech.

All cards, except the Christmas, are bad - either advancing the potential failure of the Mission, or giving player Hard Knocks, which are problems that the soldiers must deal with (like Hardheaded - you cannot withdraw while having 1 or more cards in hand).

Withdraw means the player no longer plays in that Mission, and the Support is a token with which the player chooses one other player to try to help get rid of Hard Knocks.

A Luck Charm makes one card from the No Man's Land (where Threats cards are played) be discarded, which increases the chances of the Mission being successful. The same is valid for the Speech, which only the Leader or former leaders have, and by using a Speech token, the player chooses a Threat and everyone (except the player giving the Speech) can discard from the hand one card that has that Threat. Speeches, once used, are removed from the game.

At the end of a Mission, either players won (by retreating safely or playing all the cards in their hands), which will give everyone that didn't already be able to give support to someone; or lose, which makes all the cards in the No Man's Land to be shuffled back into the Trials deck, and no one else, except those that withdraw before the end of the Mission, can give support.

Once the Mission is over, the support tokens are revealed. If one player was chosen to receive support more than anyone else, this player will be able to get rid of 2 Hard Knocks or recover their Good Luck Charm. If there is a tie in the support, no one gets it.

If the players, during the Mission, discared all their cards and the Peace card is showing (the Trials card deck is kept above it), the war is over, everyone is alive and players win!

If after the Mission, there are still Trials cards above the Peace card or someone has cards in hand, the play continues. The Moral drops (cards equal to the amount of cards in the hand of the players, or a minimum of 3), meaning that cards are taken from the Morale deck and passes to the Trials deck. The Leader token passes to the next player, and she decides which will be the intensity (how many cards will be from the Trials deck that round) of the Mission. A new Mission begins and play continues like this until players win, or the Monument card (bellow the Morale deck) shows up, which means that the players have lost. Players also lose if a soldier has 4 or more Hard Knocks after the Support phase.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which cards to play, considering the status of the Mission and the Hard Knocks your soldiers has already;
- When to use the Luck Charm;
- When to give a Speech (but not everyone will be able to make one);
- When to withdraw and to who give support.

Most of the time the last three decisions are more clear. Speeches are needed early in the Missions, when there are more cards in hand. Luck Charms, though most will be a once per game use, normally aren't worth to hold back, as its use won't increase in usefulness later.

Withdraw and play a card are trickier. With the card play the current status of the Mission says what you should or shouldn't play for Threat cards. If is a card that will cause de Mission to fail, you shouldn't; if the Threat won't trigger this,  you probably should. When the card is a Hard Knock is harder to evaluate, as the effect of them are continuous and can be really nasty, but holding them in the hand will cause the Morale to drop faster. Is a fine balance. But with good support, is possible to get rid of them, so they might be worth playing, even with their ill effects taking place, as they won't drop Morale and could be discarded - win, win.

Withdraw depends even heavier on game state and cards in the hand, so it is hard to say when to do it or don't. The simple is: if you can play a Threat, play it, instead of Withdrawing. If you can't, then Withdraw.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Marvelous art;
- Easy rules, making for a smooth gameplay;
- Very quick, with low downtime;
- Speeches are fun to give, especially if you require an actual little speech;
- Uncommon theme for cooperative games.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Not much actual cooperation during Missions, but Support can be key to win;
- No solo alternative out of the box;
- Luck of the draw can decice a game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In [thing=171668][/thing] you will be like in a war - not the WWI, though, but one against the game. You will want to play a card, but simply won't be able, and will need to withdraw. You might feel ashamed, for not being able to help more, but at least the cofee will be ready when everyone returns from the Mission. You might feel angry, that yet again, Charles made impossible for you to continue - he is like that since school.

[thing=171668][/thing] offers an unsual setting for the game do develop, and it is weird that is unsual, as cooperation in war time seems granted and everyone comprehends it immediately. Maybe is too ""real"" for some groups and households. Still, as I mentioned, [thing=171668][/thing] is mostly an abstract puzzled - there are no battles, do dead. A battle starting is a whistle card. Guns, explosives, firefight, are a shell card. Chemical attacks is a mask card. [thing=171668][/thing] isn't a simulation nor tries to make players feel in the proper war - this might be positive or negative to you, but it is what it is.

I wish there was more cooperation built in the gameplay, however, playing we did talked, complained and tried to work together a lot, which is nice.

In the end, [thing=171668][/thing] passed well in the test of taste: everyone in my group liked it and we ended up playing several times in a row, which I think will be usual for it, given its time frame and the ability of appearing to be close to a winning end, only for the Morale to drop, someone never being able to use all her cards and a defeat being unapologetic tossed in our faces. [thing=171668][/thing] goes well recommended."

1998,tro6inson,7.5,"1st impression: Intriguing little coop game. After two plays I'm not sure if there are depths I'm not getting my head around or whether the game is actually just simpler than I think it might be. Similar in many ways to Hanabi (each player has a hand of cards, the aim is for the group to play those cards in the correct sequence, but communication is limited) but a bit more random and therefore less analytical than Hanabi. This makes The Grizzled an inherently more fun game... except the theme firmly roots the experience in a dark, intense place. I could see a horror/cthulhu retheme of these mechanics doing well.
Update: After the third play I'm seeing that the game is indeed simpler than I thought. It's really about finding the occasional tactical combo play than anything particularly strategic. Also I'm thinking the more you focus on mechanics the easier it is to desensitise to the theme - is that a good thing? Or the ultimate statement on war and the men who wage it?"

The game is so simple that it left me wondering ""That's it?"" after it was explained to me.  But it works.  The most unique thing about this game relative to other coops is that you feel very strongly about the other players.  You're spending a lot of time trying to figure out who to support, and looking at how you can set up the other players.  You're not spending so much time trying to beat a system, as just trying to get everybody through.  That feels a lot like World War I, despite the abstraction of the mechanics.  The dark and foreboding style of the art is wonderful, but it is leavened by a doodling line style that brings just enough lightheartedness to keep the game playable without being entirely depressing.  There's a grim humor about the whole game, which melds perfectly with WWI."

2058,vladdswrath,7,"The Grizzled is the most abstract war game I've ever played. Game play is sort of an anti-match three, as players work together to play as many cards as possible without playing any three of the same suit. This is complicated by the fact that most cards have two or three different suits on the same card. Instead of playing a suited card, players sometimes have the option of playing a trauma card, which allows them to dodge playing a regular card (that would likely create the dreaded three of a kind) but the price from doing that is some sort of effect that makes the rest of the game even harder.

If that was all there was to it, the game would be interesting for a minute or two, but largely forgettable. Of course, there is something more. The theme, 5 friends in a trench trying to survive the Great War is heart-wrenching. Turn after turn you go on missions, but whether they are a success or failure, nothing really changes in the narrative. When the game ends, you don't even know if your side has won the war. It just ends, and you have survived. It's almost a meaningless result.

Seriously. There is almost no way to finish this game smiling, win or lose. The art also does an incredible job of communicating the theme. The drawings are almost caricature, but the silliness makes the soldiers somewhat more endearing, increasing both your attachment to them as well as the sorrow you feel for their hardships.

Tragically, the artist for the game was Tignous, who was tragically murdered in the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in France...making the anti-war message of this game even more poignant.

It's going to let you think you're doing well, getting very close to the end just before victory is snatched away from you. You'll grimace as you place the card with all six threats on it and hope your comrades can remove it or handle it without withdrawing early. You'll wince as you become mute, develop a phobia of whistles, and selfishly support yourself. You'll cheer when it's Christmas and one of your comrades gets just a little respite from the war. And you'll know defeat as the war memorial becomes visible at the end of that last round. Yet, you too might get to feel that surprise as you look around at your nearly dead friends with no cards in their hand while the dove of peace is visible and question this very tenuous win.

The designers purposely wish to convey, in some small way, the horror and agony of close combat warfare but finding within its depths of despair true valantry, brotherhood, and heroics. Unique game objectives and interactive game systems take a few plays to figure out. Players take turns as the unit leader, there is an interesting set collection of bad things in your hand while managing the depletion of a survival stack, secret sharing (or hoarding) your supplies with your team, accumulating personal war traumas, and delivering a morale boosting speech that saves the day. I dig a hard, challenging coop that requires thoughtful teamwork, against the odds,  desperate for just a bit of luck. This is a heavy theme, but I appreciate that this game accomplishes this sense of teamwork while sharing a time that I, fortunately, have no experience of what it must have been like."

I am not a fan of the rulebook.  For what is essentially an iteration-based microgame, the rulebook doesn't really cover all bases it should (will include examples if I ever go over this entry again).

Gameplay and feelings:

Brilliant game. The choices are grueling, quite on purpose. I can see a victory of this game to be very very satisfying.  Unsure if excellent strategic choices/well-hit mitigative choices will bring about a victorious outcome each time.  That will require many many more plays.

This take a bit of the wind out of its sails to me, but give the small package I'm hanging on to it for sure.

Update: We played one facet incorrectly. We allowed the Speech-giver to also discard a Threat from their hand, which is incorrect. Only the recipients of the Speech are allowed to discard a card.

Its intense figuring out how to get through each round and even trickier when the debility cards start piling up.
