4,amitche1,8,"Scratches a lot of the same itches as armada but with much better support than FFG gave armada.  Has theme, spatial mechanics, deck/list building, and strong tactical play.  The variants are all interesting so far.  Seems to handle multi-player well.  It's expensive if you want everything, but just proxy the cards."

"
6,apubigred13,N/A,Make me an offer.
7,Askes_far,8,"A very good miniatures game system. 

Affordable and fast playing are huge plusses for me. 

Negatives that hold the game back for is the terrible availability of products and uneven release schedule as well as constant rules tweaks and revisions."

16,Blackjack006,9,Great game. Rules are easy to understand. Tactics deck and Non-Combat Unit bring a new breath to battle game. Awaiting some new units !
17,blagojevity,8,"One of my top 3 war game like go to. Like the system. Great minies and production. Space monster though, especially if you want more factions and/or units(as expected).
Rating dropped:
Due to ongoing changes in rules and cards without offering replacement cards. Not into printing out components also APP not up to date."
18,Boarder83,10,I just love this game. Its the best war game I have ever played.
19,boardmathias,3,"Boring attempt on a miniature game. Actually bad, but I guess the license will sell a few."
20,Bombance,10,"One of the best Wargame I have ever played, if not the best. The Political Board is genius. A lot of very interesting decisions. The only gripe is that the game can be swingy at times because it is dice based, but eventually the game rewards the better player.

21,Boodog,8,"Great game. Interesting interactions across  the political tract, tactics cards, and unit capabilities (and game mode!)

25,brotherfranciz,N/A,Unopened and still in wrapping. Kickstarter edition with all the Kickstarter-exclusive miniatures.
26,butakka,9,"What a great game.  So much strategy and variance in creating your armies.  It was a real treat to be able to play in two different tournaments at Gen Con.  With the base set, you have enough content to make a 30 point army of Lannisters and a 30 point army of Starks.  Besides the starter set, there is also the Night's Watch, Free Folk, and Baratheon sets you could collect. Plus, you can purchase individual unit boxes to expand what ever army you have.  This game can be a huge money pit, so watch out if you are a completionist. The more copies of a unit you have, the more well rounded, adaptable, and expansive your armies can be.  Until I want to spend hundreds of more dollars, I'm sticking with the Starks and Lannisters.  
Player count best to worst: 2,(almost exclusively) 4,3"
27,calbond,7.5,First Tabletop miniatures game I’ve ever played. Really liked the streamlined aspect of having all troops move as units. Cards added a nice layer of strategy over the tactics of the battlefield.
28,Capadokia,5,"Gameplay is oké
Miniatures are just for the life of the squad and too replace one for a character with additional ability.

My problem with this is that it makes the setup and tear down a b@&$!, rather play wildlands for quick easy fast action packed game or rising sun what is worth the setup time

Maybe I just don’t like any warhammer Tabletop style game..."

Very thematic, great mechanics and game balance, and the continued support from CMON makes it seem like this game will be around for quite awhile (unlike some of CMON's previous offerings)"
37,CombatOZ,10,Gameplay is fantastic- lot of tactical movement and desicion to make. Easy to get into rules but deep and highly tactical gameplay. To me- best rank and file tabletop ever!
38,csmbrwn,9,"Once I learned that the main game mode (A Game of Thrones) was vastly inferior to A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords game modes, I had a great deal of fun and felt the game was more strategic. It is a dice/chance heavy game, and a war game with less finesse given its unit trays, but it is still quite enjoyable."
39,cuberthunder,10,"Uno de los juegos mas diivertidos que he jugado ultimamente.
Tiene cierto azar en los combates pero se equilibra con las tacticas. 
Muy adictivo"

46,Deathbyppt,9,"Only played a little bit, so can't speak to the overall balance, but it's a fun wargame for folks wanting to get into miniature wargaming, without playing one of the bigger games. Minis are outstanding quality. Starter box is a good value, an additional units/heroes aren't necessary, but will add some needed variety if you plan to play a lot. Rules are well written and easily referenced, as are the cards. Thing that's keeping it from a 10/10 for me is the slight lack in variety from the starter set. I imagine this game will be a lot more popular when more factions are released. Recommend Highly!"

My teenage daughters play the game with me, and we’ve had the chance to attend two small tournaments so far... looking forward to a lot more in the future.  One thing I particularly like, other than the slick gameplay, is army construction.  I enjoy planning my army units, and selecting a Commander who complements the strategy I want to play out on the table.  The only reason I gave the game a 9 and not a 10 is that the plastic miniatures, although fantastic, are not quite the best.  They are very detailed, and paintable, and beginner friendly since they come pre-assembled... but they have some minor flaws.  That said, this is a fantastic game.  Great value for the money.  You should really give it a try."

111,KingRobtheIV,8,"A great game with constant support from both CMON and the community. The models are amazing (I wish the faces were a little better sculpted) with nice dynamic poses and enough variance in unit models to make each tray unique. The game mechanic is similar enough to warhammer fantasy 7th edition that people are familiar with but with all the trim removed. This leads to a much more streamline play without the bulk of many unique and individual rules. The game includes an interesting ""outside"" dynamic by adding in NPCs that buff or debuff units on the board while the main army is built of ground soldiers, cavalry and war machines with various ""hero"" upgrades all based on maximum points. The point values are per unit or character which makes for ""clean"" army lists vs the finickiness of other war game systems."

149,paul10liao,7,"規則:
*建軍  決定遊戲的規模，大中小分別有50/40/30招募值可用，根據單位牌背面下方招募值計算，每種單位招募時根據類型拿對應底版裝滿對應模型，玩家起始要選擇家族，只能使用該家族的單位跟最多一半比例的中立單位，該家族統帥只能選一個，根據統帥拿對應的戰術牌跟六張統帥戰術牌組成20張牌庫洗勻蓋著，每個玩家只能有一個統帥，將領類型的要加到對應類型的兵種(放到該盤的左前格)，沒特別說每盤只能有一個將領
*然後選擇遊玩模式，一輪結束時，如果有玩家是最高分且根據規膜達到12/10/8分則勝利，第六輪結束時最高分的贏，平手比剩下兵的招募值和，沒有單位的玩家移出遊戲，沒特別說，殲滅對手招募值不為0的單位得一分，被友軍或是特殊效果殲滅則其他對手得一分，先劃定戰場範圍，根據膜是放置目標標記，隨機起始輪流放置地形，直到有四塊，每個地形跟地形或是跟俊隊起始地點要相距6以上，在丟骰決定誰要在哪區開始，最後選的為起始玩家，先照選擇順序輪流布置單位直到布置完，然後抽三張戰術牌
*遊戲進行多輪，每輪有兩個階段
1.激活階段 起始玩家開始輪流選一個單位做行動，之後放上行動完標記，直到場上所有單位都動過此階段結束，玩家回合都有出牌跟使用技能的機會，如果有回合開始效果也會在輪到你時觸發
*單位盤箭頭代表面向，四個角落畫出的代表方位，只有前方範圍內畫直線沒被阻擋的才在視野內，如果要算敵方在哪麼方位則取占據較多體積的，數量代表血量，每次移除都優先從最後面右邊移除，一排只要有一個單位就視為存在，將領加到單餵食卡牌疊起，效果並存
*非戰鬥單位不會放進戰場，會在戰術版圖上行動
*可執行的行動如下，也可放棄不做事，如果有額外行動可選擇任意單位執行，轉向為不改變中心點旋轉，停下後不能疊在其他盤上，移動可越過友軍但停留不能壓到盤，除了衝鋒，跟敵軍距離至少一
>佈陣 沒跟對手相連的單位可轉向後根據單位卡左上移動力往前方移動最多對應距離後，停留在轉向一次
>行軍 沒跟對手相連的單位可往前移動該單位最多移動力兩倍距離後轉向
>後退 跟對手相連的單位丟一骰，向任意個方位移動最多移動力加骰值和的距離，接戰單位如果因為此移動後沒有相連可轉向
>攻擊 選擇遠程或近戰，接戰單位不能遠程攻擊，遠程攻擊前可移位2，然後選擇視野跟射程內單位攻擊(如果對象跟其他單位接戰，友軍要結算恐慌)，接戰單位才可近戰，如果只有一個敵軍可轉向到面向，攻擊前可移位使得相接一半或全部(近戰不管視野)
>衝鋒 沒跟對手相連的單位宣告視野內目標且該方位有空間(一邊最多相接兩個)，距離在速度值+6內，攻擊方先可轉向，丟一骰加上速度往前進，有相接則成功否則失敗(擲骰1為散漫衝鋒)，成功近戰攻擊一次且可重丟任意顆骰一次，失敗要做恐慌檢定，散漫衝鋒的話不能重骰，且不能打牌
**結算攻擊 根據該單位有幾排丟對應數量骰，骰超過命中值以上算命中(6一定中1一定失敗)，防禦方重丟所有命中骰一次，防禦值以上的抵擋成功(6一定中1一定失敗)，剩下的每個結算傷害，超過單位生命就移除一個單位，防禦單位在執行恐慌檢定，沒受傷不用檢定
*因為近戰殲滅對手單位時該單位可額外執行一次佈陣，其他相接的友軍可轉向
*近戰左右方時，防禦值-1，恐慌檢定總和-1，後方都-2
*恐慌或士氣檢定 丟兩顆骰，總和大於單位下方的士氣值則過，如果是恐慌，小於士氣多少就受多少點傷害
*戰術版圖  移動非戰鬥單位時，移動到戰術版圖上空格並結算，沒空格就跳過，如果觸發影響力效果，一個單位最多只能有一個友軍一個敵軍的
*重疊效果  同樣結算時機的主動效果只能啟動一個，包括能力跟戰術牌，強制效果不限制，雙方同是要結算時，主動玩家先
*同效果的能力不疊加，號令能力使用後放置一個標記標示之，每個此能力每輪只能使用一次
*狀態標記 每種單位每種最多一個
2.重整階段 結算一輪結束效果跟得分，檢查是否有人勝利，移除所有激活標記，戰術版上模型，影響力效果，手牌可棄任意張戰術牌，補到三張，用完不會再抽，起始標記左傳，遊戲輪標記前進一格"

A few gaps in the rulebook that will hopefully be clarified over time, but at then end of the day, it's a rules-light sandbox war game. It's not heavy, it's just great fun to play. 

Miniatures are absolutely first class - up there with the best. The novels offer a wealth of opportunities to expand the game further... so many exciting places this could go."

Both were enjoyable but with xwing i didn't feel I was playing starwars. And Warhammer I couldnt care about the lore..
ASOIAF is the first minis game I owned and boy am I happy with this investment!
Unlike xwing, which my friend invested in, which we all got bored of it pretty quick .
(Even him, now it's just miniatures on a shelf ) this game is loads of fun

Simple rules mixed in with a lot of gotchas interactions. It has board game elements and tactical depth that I didn't  expect. 
The lore also is one that I'm deeply invested in. 
The game is a stream lined Warhammer game, with better lore (for me)
Better setting (for me)
And it keeps me excited for more!
Both my brother and I go over tactics and game logic over and over again.
And soon free folk and nights watch are coming!


Also as a bonus!!!! If you like to play RPGs you also get hundreds of minis for the RPG!
Especially that my friends and I are making an RPG just for ASOIAF!
Win win!!!"

171,Rhand,9.5,A beautiful--visually stunning--   game with a simple rules set. Think BATTLELORE   without the hexagonal limitations and with a superior theme/context.   The game is a true homage to  the literature and well worth a look even if you don't know a Lannister from a Stark.   For GOT fans who game--this is a must have. Very pleased with the Kickstarter--Hand of the King-- set and looking forward to expansions.

My wife usually dislike tabletop ""wargames"", but this one she just ""gets"", and i think it's due to the designers experience with boardgames that brings those mechanics that just feel right. The only notch i can see is that this game probably won't fit with highly tournament competitive players simply due to the way units are turned around, leaving a margin of error that could lead to arguments. Otherwise, very thematic, very engaging and also quite fast (for us, so far). If one is a song of ice and fire fan, that's a great game to own, especially since GRR Martin had a say into the artwork of each model."

200,TirMcdhol,9,Sorprendido me quedé el día que me hicieron una demostración de este juego. No es un juego para bolsillos pequeños desde luego como cualquier wargame creo yo. Sus reglas son sencillas y añade mecánicas nuevas basadas en el juego de tronos que hacen que una partida no se decida solo en las tripas que combaten en el tablero sino que también manejaremos a personajes que interpretaran la parte política tan importante de esta saga para dotarnos de beneficios o perjudicar al contrario desde fuera del tablero.
