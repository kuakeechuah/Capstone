10,ajewo,N/A,"Scenario-driven dungeon crawler by Rob Daviau and Eric Lang (Blood Rage, Rising Sun). 

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Artwork
+ Components: detailed plastic miniatures, Scenario boxes keep everything sorted.
+ Each scenario has a different touch and comes with special rules.
+ Special rules are bounded to a scenario which keeps the game variable and different but still less complex than other dungeon crawlers which try to simulate countless potential actions. 
+ Discovery deck provides special encounters unique to a scenario. They also provide some options for players to choose from.
+ 10 characters with special abilities that play very differently (plus team building).
+ Different items and companions granting further special effects.
+ Good balanced game that usually leads to tight game endings. Tense boss fights. Nice escalation over the course of the game.
+ Character development: you try to balance your insanity over the course of the game in order to upgrade your character.
+ Mythos deck acts as random (bad) encounters / enemy AI and also a timer for the game end.
+ Easy rules, smooth gameplay.

[b]Neutrals:[/b]
# Theme: another Cthulhu game.
# Simple combat: roll dice, you may spend stress tokens to re-roll, and see what happens.
# Luck of the draw and luck of the roll.
# Tiles often become overcrowded with miniatures and tokens.
# Scales well with 2-4 players.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Bad luck may lead to sudden death.

Played through everything from the KS except the big guy (don't own it) and it is truly an enjoyable experience. Winning by the skin of your teeth happens a lot, losing but only needing 1 or 2 more hits happens also.  I highly recommend this game.

37,azmonsoon1982,8,"A light to medium light game that helps make playing a Cthulhu Mythos style game a much more reasonable possibility.  The game is designed to play in 90 - 120 minutes, and it does pretty much that.  The fact that the packaging makes for easy setup and tear down, while the rules are well written and concise, is one that caused my board game group to want to play this much more over Arkham or Eldritch Horrors.  Strategy does exist, with 3 actions offered per round to determine how to pummel the monsters/cultists/GOO on the table.  The fact that there is no running around hunting for clues to meet an objective elsewhere (e.g., fetch quests) was well received.  

The loss of 2 points comes from only having 5 Great Old Ones on an all-in pledge, the late game becoming a dice Chuck festival, and the theme being easily interchangeable with other dungeon crawl style games. Positives, aside from those mentioned earlier, include a very well made storage solution."

Took the girl with the axe and happened to be a pyromaniac in episode 1 with Cthulhu as a boss ... was hard & l got insane, but l disrupted the ritual and bet one stage out of the old one :-)  well, yes, it's not the Lovecraft style, but it's fun & someone put the effort in some nice graphics & sculptures.
l give 8 points and would even go to 9 it coop & the other episodes are just as good.

Update: Played more, won a solo game (with one investigator, then learned that you play two in solo mode), and played one with my wife & we bet Hastur. It's still fun & the pace is quite good, indeed. We can play a game while our daughter takes her nap.

The game itself is very well made, from the massive amount of master crafted miniatures, all the way down to the tiles used for the gameplay.  The game is cooperative, and the system of the enemies being controlled by random card draws is really cool to me.  The one thing I have an issue with is the set up, which can take upwards of 30 minutes on your first time.  Other than that, this game is a must have.  Eric M.

Finally a quick (about 1h/scenario, even with 5 players), thematic, action-packed and surprisingly strategical mythos game with a vast replayability (due to the combination of scenario + Great Old One and unique characters), which equals in totally different experience on every playthrough.

62,boardchao999,9,"Lightning fast (for a game like this) Diet Mansions of Madness. Because of the simplicity of the ruleset, even though the episodes do change up how you stop the ritual, I have a feeling that the game will feel samey if you play it a bunch in a row without a break. Also, like Diet Coke vs Coke, although if feels good to drink without worrying about calories, you have to admit it doesn't taste quite the same and you miss that real sugar."
63,boardgamesdotEXE,9,"I like Mansions of Madness, but I love Death May Die. A straightforward ruleset puts all the players immediately into the action, and once a scenario starts the game never lets up. All thriller and no filler, Death May Die requires players to keep up with the pace of “Wait HOW many monsters?! Oh that’s bad!” while making important decisions that will decide the outcome of each scenario. Efficient completion of objectives and clever play will lead to a satisfying close victory. Poor use of time and actions will certainly lead to investigators being devoured by some massive existential horror.

81,Carrtmog,10,"I just did one solo play through. Even just in the set up i could tell that it was going to be extremely fun, not to mention it's extremely beautiful.

After first play... HOLY CRAP I LOVE THIS GAME! Wow, it was so much fun, even alone. I successfully defeated Hastur on episode one. But it was really close. Absolutely love love love this game. Seems to have immense replay ability, as well, which I was worried about. It is not a legacy game where once you do a scenario it's done for you. You can keep playing and even try the same scenario with a different ancient one. Everyone who backed this is going to be so happy. If you get the chance to purchase it retail, DO SO.

The enemies get stronger and stronger as the game progresses, but the interesting addition is that the investigators also get more and more powerful. So as you're getting closer and closer to death, you're also gaining new exciting abilities which keeps the game interesting to it's bitter end. 

If you wanted to like Mansions of Madness, but don't like app driven games, this is the game for you. If you do like MoM, (like i do) you'll still love this because it's different enough in new ways that it stands out from both MoM and Arkham Horror. Absolute 10."

The first play took use over a couple of hours as we figured played with various strategies with mixed results. We ended up losing, but losing was epic and fun. 

Not sure if we will ever get to exploring more than just the base game, but I'm glad I got the stretch goal player boards. This little slider pieces would otherwise be constantly knocked about. 

So in sum, fun game, decent components, similar to a number of other mythos dungeon crawlers I own, but easy to teach and therefor get to the table."

86,cbrua,7,"An interesting take on ""quicker playing Arkham Horror"".  The production quality is outstanding: beautifully drawn tiles and highly detailed miniatures with a good sense of scale.  The gameplay though is just average and gets repetitive (you're always beating up one of the two big baddies at the end).  The characters are imbalanced (some skills are clearly more useful than others) and coupled with randomly drawn insanities that vary widely in difficulty, the game can be dissatisfying for one or more players.  Overall I give it a 7: I'll happily play it, but I don't recommend it over AH/EH/MoM."

Scenarios do indeed feel like older action movie scenes like Rob & Eric mentioned in interviews during the initial press run, but it runs for way too long to really hold onto that throughout an entire scenario. The theme is also lacking and doesn't feel pulpy enough for any fans of any early 20th century pulp fiction.

I may have liked this more if I had never played The Others, but the full co-op of Cthulhu: Death May Die removes a lot of the meta and memorable player interactions, so the game is lacking in all those regards. The card timer which sorta plays the role of an opponent isn't great, but it's fine. The theme, competitive nature, and better applied mechanics work much better in The Others.

If there was a cardboard chits/no plastic version of the core game it would be a nice family weight co-op."

In the end it was quick to explain, easy to play with a limited choice of 4 different actions.

I’m not a “minis” fan, so my only comment here, is some of the minis are really too big compared to the tiles, it was impossible to fit 2 monsters, 2 characters and a few tokens in a room (after only 2 turns !).

I had the impression it looks like any crawler game, obviously with sanity, stress, phobias, linked to the Ctulhu environment :)

So it’s ok but nothing really new so I don’t think I missed anything by not pledging (also I have to mention several times I was told « rules are not finished yet, so right now in this situation we play like that but perhaps it will change »……ok….but the kickstarter ended more than 6 months ago, right ?????)."

137,DeputyCF,9,"Played the first four scenarios each with a new big bad and was amazed at how well it worked. We lost 3/4 of the games but had a blast doing it. This is rare when losing ;) Our first game was scenario 2 with Cthulhu and we had him down to 1 life but he got us. The game offers a lot of tension and seems to ramp up pretty well.

Mixing and matching the bosses with scenarios adds a ton of replay but be warned some become very difficult. For example the 3rd scenario, the Dance Macabre, we took the Black Goat expansion boss. With his dark young and the scenarios deep ones, they kept on repanwing like crazy due to their passive mosnter abilities. One has it when it deals dmg it spawns another monster and the other has it if the player deals dmg but doesn't kill it, it spawns another one. It was a crazy combo for the baddies ;)

My favorite mechanic is how sanity works. The more insane you go the stronger you become. but be careful to save some sanity up for the big bad they eat away at it quickly! Sanity allows you to level up one of your character's skills and on certain milestones get an extra die to add to your dice pool making your player more deadly but also closer to death. 

I'm happy that each scenario feels pretty different, at least in the first 4 that I've played. My group is super happy with it which allows me to justify the huge expense of getting everything ha."
138,derdmeh,8,"For socializing fun. The game is well-balanced and can go down to the wire, cooperation is required. But it may be if anything a little too easy. The characters are interestingly distinct from one another. As a whole it is presented with a sense of humor I find amusing (e.g. an axe-wielding teen named ""Borden"" and a little girl named ""the kid"" whose tagline is just unlimited laughter)."

Third, the game constantly makes you feel ""awesome"" as you dispatch the cultists and monsters while slowly going insane.  Also, using the ""insanity"" tracker to give your character upgrades was brilliant.

Personally after Bloodrage and Rising Sun i was really looking forward to the next Eric Lang's game and as a huge fan of Mansions of Madness since edition 1 this was a must buy before the campaign launched. But then i had time to see how the campaign was driven, what was offered and to watch the gameplay video. I didn't like either of them, exclusivity is good, exploiting reputation of past games and a commonly loved theme to sell a 100$+ unpainted statue and make it looks like it is a ""board"" on where you play the game is just a non-sense to me, i get that the company is based on miniatures (50cm tall miniature????) but i back a boardgame for its content and not for the weight of the plastic in the box. As for the game itself, and this is the main reason why i canceled my pledge, it really just looks like a basic dungeon crawler with simplistic rules already seen and overused in this genre, you just move around rolling dice form start to end, they tried to add complexity with the insanities cards that gives you some sort of malus that you can also exploit in some situations and they tried to add variety with the scenario boxes (last time i checked there were 6 scenarios) that you combine with the great old one but both of this mechanisms fail to convince me, just not what i'm looking for 220$."

I like the theme and characters (which was a problem I have with The Others), felt hard but balanced between the heroes, whereas in zombicide it's more dependent on randomly finding gear. In addition I like the way if you have three people there are three investigators, rather than always using six like in Z. In addition I like the small tiles, they aren't really a problem and shrink the table space of an already big game and barely fit in the box anyway. Overall I am impressed, this has also shifted eldritch horror out of the collection.

Still liking this."

160,DrSquidly,9,This feels sort of like a mix of Zombicide and Mansions of Madness/Arkham Horror.  Managing your characters madness for additional powers and also not dying from too much madness is exciting.  The interchangable Gods with the different missions adds quite a bit of replayability.
161,Drujeful,9,"This has quickly become my favorite solo game. The streamlined mechanics and gameplay make it easy for one player to control as many investigators as they need to be able to beat the Elder One. The theme and mechanics compliment each other for a great Lovecraft game. The way any Elder One can combine with any episode adds quite a bit of replayability. And every episode introduces unique mechanics that make the game feel different every time. Very much recommend, even though it's a tough game to win."
162,DrWorm331,10,"Amazing production! Game is very fun and interesting choices abound for all players. Player powers get crazy as you advance along your path to madness. This balance is tempting and deadly.

The only complaint that I agree with about this game is that the spaces can be a little small for the amount of stuff you need to put there. This is minor for me, because it reduces table space required and It's kind of humorous to pile up overflow enemies.

The KS dashboards are getting a few complains of flimsiness, but I am extremely happy with them. I dislike tokens sitting on a dashboard without some way to hold them in place. They do the job and I am so glad CMON considers players like me.

As you'd expect, the replay ability is off the charts with there Episode/Boss combination mechanic.

I actually think the 90 to 120 minutes will be correct once players have played one time. This is going to make it easy to get to the table often."

The actual game is so simple that I've been able to teach this game within 5-10 minutes as all you do is take 3 actions of moving, attacking, resting and taking special actions specific to the episode you're playing. 

Of course there's a little bit more to that but I gotta keep this super short so...go buy the game!

I haven't played a ton of cooperation games, but I have played a handful to know that this game really makes you talk about how you can sync your abilities together even more so than something like Pandemic.

The only downside this game really has is the setup is long. Maybe cause I got the kick-starter version, but going through choosing the characters then taking out all the stuff needed for that episode (and that's me already organising the tokens into a container for easy access!) can take 10-15 minutes depending on how fast you are.

196,fortheloveofdice,N/A,Sept 2019?
197,FreeArt,1,Predatory practices.
198,Froh,1,"Game looks good. Awful practices from the publisher.

Edit : Mostly to answer ""voydangel"", because we are haters of some sort, because dismissing other people opinions is always great. Here's what really happened.

CMON used to be a good publisher even with the nonsense exclusives that plague their (retails) games.
Apart from that, we could expect some kind of respect of their backers.

And then it came,
- A mega-miniature, teased before as the ""Epic finale of the campaign"". Want to emphasize the words ""Epic Finale"" as it's teased as an important part of the campaign, which is an important part of the game itself. So despite the very strange idea of having a giant miniature as a base where a map could works too and suppose all players have a place for this thing, let's say why not.
- Of course, teasing an important GAMEPLAY part, they did underestimate the fact that people could want to finish their campaign with the finale. That's when the ""badly handed"" part begin => This epic final was NOT an Early Bird at all. It was limited as the required production is kinda hard to do. By creating slots, they did assume that not a lot of people could be interested in this, and then created others slots, giving them a margin in time (so first backers will receive this ""epic finale"" sooner than others, which is kinda normal IF IT WERE ANNOUNCED BEFORE). Then the price increases for absolutely no reason. The ""official excuse"" was because they had to work another mold for each batch, but the second mold won't cost more than the first mold. So late backers will be now punished twice. By waiting more, AND by paying more.
- Also note that CMON do not use Early Bird any more for years now. So yeah, it was not thought as an EB at all.
- Now when I say ""late backers"", I must explain that it was late backers by merely SECONDS. Kickstarter being kinda bad at handling huge amount of people did refuse even ""first arrived"" on the payment part. This is KS mistake here, but CMON SHOULD know KS weaknesses which is why they DID stop with Early Birds in previous campaigns.
- Instead of explaining themselves, or just tell that they will open more slots in the comments where people were asking questions. They did it without again announcing it, which leads to first backers having missed the slots, to also miss the next batches. So yeah they DID handle it VERY badly.
- On the finale expansion part which costs too much : The ""big mini"" doesn't cost that much for a production of this size. But a ""without megature"" expansion would be fair for backers who don't want such a thing and still play the ""epic finale"". 
- On the completionnist ""issue"". Well. That's not an issue if you actually play the game. That's an issue if you can't play the full campaign by having the ""finale"" linked to this. So yeah. You kinda ""need it"" if you actually want to get the ""complete gameplay"" at the moment.

This is what ""really"" happened. And this is why we should have the right to express our negative opinion without being belittled as ""haters"".

Now if you read both comments, you have both parts of the story. Will answer pm if you need to get more information."

(Which I will admit is a thing, but it is minor and almost seems cooler to a point to have this odd overflow of enemies off the tile) I can't find any real flaws with this game.
 The set up and tear down is super quick because the game is set up great the type of customization the game provides. Grab a boss, grab an episode, mix, throw your hero(es) down and GO.
  The game is also very simple, maybe just teetering on the too simple side, but the beauty of that anyone can play this game. If you are even remotely a fan of horror games or the Lovecraft mythos, you will be able to enjoy this game.
 Production is typical CMON style, so the art is good, the graphic design is on point, and the minis are wonderful as always.
  This is a through and through ""amerithrash"" (I hate labels) style game. You get a couple actions, you roll some dice, and see if things play out as you want. Then the game slams you with bad stuff. Nothing new here. However, the speed is great, and the way the game feels different each play with the various combos between old ones and episodes keep things fresh. The thing that ties it together though stays the same each time. Fast, fun, and simple play to keep things rolling and engaging.
  Skews a little to the hard side at the lower player counts, but there is a good deal of randomness and that's the way co-ops should feel, especially with this theme.

Basically, if you want to throw down some dice in a horror style, objective based dungeon crawl-ish game. You won't find anything better."

The theme is the same, the minis are good but don't add much to the game itself but the mechanics are stripped down to the bare minimum of mechanics, e. g. moving and rolling dice to fight and defend. It doesn't really matter which Elder One you choose because there's no real story, no adventure, no progression, no real decisions except which monsters I want to fight.

247,Hgg11,8.5,"I just love this game because it is so difficult! it only makes me want to play again when I lose to try to win it is fantastic. it's a dice game, but I think luck here is easily managed. The theme is very good is a very very themed game, and we can feel the strength of the boss and the creatures and the illustrations and figures are of the highest quality! In summary it is easily one of the best games I have played very good this year!

260,inuitmyth909,10,"The absolute Great Old One of heavy metal pedal to the floor shotguns on fire high octane fast and furious boardgaming. Absolutely spectacular in every way. Beautiful packaging, components, easy peasy rules that bring depth to Ameritrash while maintaining the frantic fun, speedy set up, fast playing... We even love the little tiles that end up crammed with minis because it looks chaotic and keeps the table space needed down. Head over heels in love with this. One more thing - I hate solo gaming, never seen the point, never had fun. Yesterday I played six rounds in a row with the same set up, solo. One of my favourite gaming sessions of recent times. Oh yeah - and the replay ability is insane (sic), as long as you continue to enjoy the activity and mechanics you could play this forever. AM-MA-ZING."
261,ixitotem,8.5,"Fairly simple dungeon crawler but all of the moving parts fit together exceptionally well with a loose emergent story.  Exciting, fun to solo and also good for somewhat casual gamers.  Incredible components, artwork and storage; I feel like I actually got my money's worth and then some.  I like the insanity as experience (and the way the player's insanity triggers).  I also like the way they incorporated the timer, monster movement, and special events all into one mythos deck.  The exploration cards are fun and could be beneficial or harmful.  I would say combat in Zombicide Black Plague actually feels more tactical.  They are different enough from each other that there is room for both."

The myths of Cthulhu do not show so many monsters in the same scenario, on the contrary, they try to build suspense around a single myth, which grows and grows until revealing the horrifying creature and in the end, the outcome of the protagonist, if he succeeded. barely survive with psychological trauma or never seen again and we know about him because of some data that he left before disappearing."

281,jim.brooks10,10,"Easily the best game to come along in quite a while for me. I've played the first 3 scenarios so far, and each was a nail-biter, coming down to a last desperate win or die roll.  I've also only played this solo, so I would expect to love it even more with the right group.  I often like the idea of solo play more than the actual experience, but this game is a huge exception.  Solo is great.  Yes, there's tons of die rolls, so people adverse to this may want to avoid, but that doesn't mean there's no decisions to be made and no ways to mitigate bad die rolls.  Also, I was originally skeptical that the main goal of disrupting the ritual may get stale, but the first three missions have varied this enough to make each experience distinct and interesting so far.  I liked this so much that I need up purchasing Season 2 retail. If you missed the Kickstarter, I'd say there's enough in the base game (all I've used so far) to make this a great purchase.  The Kickstarter extras box is nice, but certainly not necessary for enjoyment.  If you like the base game, you can still get Season 2 retail.
Now, CMON, please make a Tabletop Simulator version."
282,jimavet,9.5,"Soloable:  Love the game, despite not being a huge fan of the theme.  Each character has their own unique ability and two common-pool abilities, along with the fact that there is a ton of characters to choose from, means that you can repeat games / campaigns and trying out different combinations of characters. If I didn't have so many games in my collection, I could see this being a game that I would play often / frequently.  I can also appreciate that a 3-player vs 5-player game results in a shift in priorities as lower player counts hasten the speed at which you can gain new abilities."

286,johnb4bgg,N/A,"Lotsa good buzz about the game with peeps saying: ""surprised how good it is"" & easy to learn. but also swingy & toon skills have must-have spots. Zee is iffy."
287,johnprestonevans,9,"One of the more accessible ""Cthulhu"" games out there. The design is simple and clever. Take one part mission (of which there are 6 out of the core box), and one part Ancient One (sadly only 2 come with the core), mix components and quickly set up the map. Each mission has its own set of objectives, tokens and monsters to contend with. All the while the Ancient One moves ever closer to being summoned by his cultists. Eventually you will have to battle this beast as both your character, and his powers escalate as the game progresses.

This is a brilliant cooperative game with fast moving mechanics, streamlined rules (for a Cthulhu game), and a lot of replay-ability. It captures a similar feel to Mansions of Madness, but with less time investment and cumbersome combat. I would be remissed if I didn't gush over the miniatures. Arguably one of the best collections CMoN has put out to date. 

While the map tiles are gorgeous to look at, they are a bit on the small side. Also, it would have been nice to have at least 1 more Ancient One in the core box too. But you can get exponentially more variety with the expansions that bring tons more investigators, missions and monsters to be mixed and matched. "

292,jsmaple64,8,Good game. Need larger map boards or smaller miniatures.
293,jsteim,10,"I really love this game.  To me, the gameplay feels more like a true H.P. Lovecraft story than any other Lovecraftian game that I have played--and I really like these games.

Specifically, the investigators begin the game running -- right through flame and into rooms where cultists and other monsters are waiting.  The baddies then chase the investigators while the investigators are catching on fire and still rushing to destroy labs (this is Episode 1, the first that one plays, I guess).  And THEN things go quickly from bad to worse.

The first time I played, the game ended with a single investigator in a room full of fire, fire all over his clothes, four or five cultists in the room, three or four monsters, including Cthulhu himself.  My investigator stood alone, and died alone.

The second time I played, it was much more successful.  We still lost, though we got awfully close to destroying the Ancient One.  The third time was even better--still lost, just as we did the fourth time, but only by a hair both times.  I thought our investigators might sacrifice everything, including our lives, in the end as still win.  But we didn't.

As I said, no other game captures the urgent desperation and the crushing weight of ominous and imminent death--even while there is still a hope and a possibility of success--as does Cthulhu: Death May Die.  It is JUST LIKE a real Lovecraftian tale.

I love it."

Solo-played the first scenarios with Cthulhu-Hastur-Cthulhu with 2-2-3 different investigators. Won the last one. Even when I lost I still felt the game rich, exciting and full of hype! 
The combination of scenarios (6+3 in the KS SG box) and old ones (2+2 in the  KS SG box) and the numerous investigators make the game highly replayable. Set-up is a bit tedious but the gameplay is straightforward. It only takes 30-50 min to finish one scenario."

312,kissgg,1,Rating of 1 for mistreating the literary legacy of H.P. Lovecraft.
313,kissmyale,N/A,"In Cthulhu: Death May Die, inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, you and your fellow players represent investigators in the 1920s who instead of trying to stop the coming of Elder Gods, want to summon those otherworldly beings so that you can put a stop to them permanently. You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible — or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.

The game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.

The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players."

I have been having a lot of fun with it."
317,Kuhellhell,10,Good
318,kwulfe,8,"Its a well designed tactical miniature game which offers a fair challenge. I have only played 2-player matches so far and it is not easy to win.
Replayability is good as there are six scenarios in the core box and 10 different investigators. But the core box only offers to elders so that you have seen all different myth cards relatively fast.
One aspect I would criticize is that the second part of the scenarios, that means killing the elder, feels more or less generic as you know what to do when you have already faced the same elder in another scenario. But the first part of each scenario, interrupting the ritual, is always specfic.
Overall I like Death May Die a lot and it is a very motivating game."

322,larryjrice,5,"FIRST IMPRESSION:

The theme is getting old although I understand why it is used so much since it is public domain - but I don't particularly enjoy the theme. Our first play proved challenging and we failed spectacularly but we didn't do a good job focusing on the task at hand and when Cthulu entered life took a drastic turn for the worse. I don't have a huge desire to return to this one but will if my group wants to try again. Rules wise, this is a fairly streamlined cooperative game and you do need to manage your stress well. I also think the system for upgrading your character to be an interesting mechanic - as you slowly get driven insane, you level up your powers. You actually want to go a little insane early I think just to pick up some special abilities."

It is simple, enjoyable, tense, and something that I can play with just about anyone!  

The modular system is what makes it for me I think.  Any Elder one with Any Episode means I have tons of replayability.  The character leveling is fun. Although it is weird that I want to go insane, the way that track works is such a great mechanic!  I want to push myself to the limits, but not too far so I don't die!

CDMD is everything I want in a game.  Fairly simple to learn and understand.  Simple to play.  Co-op.  Hysterical things befalling players.  Amazing models.  

Now, there are definitely similarities to Zombicide.  Zombiecide is pretty cool, entertaining, but not the greatest game in the world.  CDMD takes zombicide, gives it some meth and pcp, then lets it loose on the world.

Instead of just getting stronger as you kill.  You get stronger as you...well go insane.  So the close to death you are, the tougher you are.  Instead of larger and larger masses of weenie bad guys, you get an alien GOD!

This review includes the ""Giant Cthuhlu"" model expansion.  The model is amazing.  The gameplay when you use him in the game is neat, but since he's so damn big, it's kind of tough to move things around.  You need a lazy susan, or friends on the other side of the table to move your model."
372,mercopparis,7,"The result of a superstar design duo, Cthulhu: Death May Die is a bit of a thematic twist of the traditional Cthulhu formula. Instead of merely trying to survive, you're actively trying to take the ancients down. 

For game play, I found it to be a surprisingly clean system. You've got 3 action points per turn and most of them are standard fair (attack, move, etc.). There's dice rolling and mitigation mostly in the form of rerolls at the cost of ""stress."" You go further insane each time tentacles are rolled, but that's actually a good thing; it's the way you level up on your three tech trees. Only once you max out do you die, but up until then you're constantly pressing your luck for more.

The games are episodic in nature which provides a narrative structure, and the variety comes in the form of which Elder God you choose. It's a fun mashup that provides interesting twists each time you play. The game length is pretty good overall; it doesn't overstay its welcome too much.

Overall, it has been an enjoyable experience so far. The potential cons are basically all things you know about going into the game: dice rolls, constant spawning, a saturated theme, and the CMON ""buy everything now"" model. But this isn't an over-bloated Zombicide spin off; it's a lean, straight-to-the-point experience. I'm definitely looking forward to more plays. "

399,mxt305,1,I have looked forward to this game. However the stuffs are not attracting me. The girl in the game looks like a boy who wear woman's clothes.
400,Mystic_Mouse,6,"Pretty simple yet strategic coop of risk management with lots of dice chucking. Game is 10-15% easier with a larger player count, so there's a small balance issue. Medium game time (2 hrs) with setup and tear down. There's replayability if you invest in expensive expansions, but the general feel is samey. Wish there were more than two Old Ones in the base set. Each episode comes with different chits, maps, and two actions to take. The final big bad phases are simply brutal, and it seems that you really have to sacrifice players just to win. Since dice rolls are key to surviving, this is about as Ameritrash as you can get, yet exciting for it. 

The rooms are too small to hold all of the miniatures, but I actually house rule that they've got to wait until they can fit in the room to come in. Even with this rule, the game is difficult. Excuse me, I need to find a closet for when Cthulhu comes looking.  Oh, he just spawns from the toilet? Great. Some rooms the big bad doesn't even fit in with two characters, so the design issue is quite annoying. 

I'll have to get more games in, but so far I'd rather play Arkham Horror LCG or even Eldritch Horror rather than this. This has a very different style of play, more akin to Black Plague; you race around completing tasks, leveling up, collecting a few items, then an abomination with four lives and psionic mind attacks picks up a character and rips him in half driving you too insane to continue.  Fun?  If you want Black Plague with more of a challenge, then hell yeah.

I had always kind of been wary of CMON games in general as they often come across as mindless dice chuckers, and while this certainly has plenty of dice chucking, there is a lot that can be done to help mitigate the risk.

The time to table is good, 20 to 30 minutes for a 1 to 3-hour game.  The storage solution is good and the sheer amount of characters along make for plenty of replayability even on chapters you've already beaten.  Always a joy playing this game."

418,odinsgrandson,9,"This game is quite a good combat oriented dungeon crawler.  A lot of variety in the scenarios, elder gods and investigators makes for a lot of options in play style.

This plays very different from other Cthulhu games that I often play- the investigators power up really high so that they can take on the big bad.

The Insanity as Experience Points mechanic is especially interesting, since it creates a sort of long term Push Your Luck  experience.

And the components are all top notch- especially the miniatures."

FFG games from Arkham files series at least try to implement Cthulhu mythos. They often misfire, but sometimes atmosphere is there. Death May Die is a completetly shallow, primitive monster slasher, just using lovecractian theme as a trendy backdrop. Judging by kickstarter success, this is exactly what players want: huge minis, whatever familiar theme and pointless dice rolling at endlessly respawning monsters. Player agency and meaningful choices are laughable at best. I have many of the same grudges with Arkham Horror, but comparing to DMD those are much better games."

424,Orion44,10,I had a chance to play a demo game and it was fantastic. I can't compare it to the others as I haven't played but it's a fun and thematic romp to bash cultists and keep the horrors off the board. It is quite fun to shoot a starspawn in the face.
425,Orphebus,6,"Not a great design, but it's fun to play. In order to be powerful and win, you have to suffer ""injuries""; consequently, most games are thrilling, because you are on the edge. Plus, the characters are not balanced. The combat system is subpar but fast. Setup takes its time and you have to open close ""paper"" boxes. Takes a lot of shelve space."

This game is just a streamlined / simplified Zombicide kind of game, with a deadline added to the base engine: Nothing special about the design, unless you're a Cthulhu fan, which I am not. For me, playing this game is simply an act of good will towards the other players...

*放置故事板，選擇一個邪神，模型放在招換軌綠色最左邊格，放置小兵參考卡在圖板上，邪神階段卡照數字疊起放在對應位置，選擇一個章節，將8張神話卡跟邪神的8張洗勻放好，怪物參考卡放對應位置並拿出對應模型，根據章節卡牌背設置地圖跟標記還有敵人模型，將章節的發現卡洗勻放一旁
*每個人挑一個玩家板(單人至少用兩個角色)，對應模型放在起始第點，選一個顏色拿標記，六個標記放在生命壓力跟神智軌起始格，跟三個技能的最左邊格，每人發一張瘋狂卡剩下移除，隨機起始
*遊戲中丟骰時檢定(正常都三黑)，驚嘆後代表成功次數或是傷害，有觸手則神智軌降一，每次丟骰後可花一點壓力重丟任意一顆
*神智軌如果在一次降低時降超過閥值則停在該閥值，結算你的瘋狂卡，選一個技能升級
*遊戲輪流進行，每個玩家回合有四個階段
1.執行三個行動，可重複
>奔跑 移動到相鄰格最多三格，有經過敵人就帶著走，離開火場則有幾個火焰標記就放幾個到角色板
>攻擊 選擇同格目標丟骰檢定，每個成功一點傷害，超過怪物生命就消滅，邪神要在儀式被破壞才能打
>休息 在沒有敵人的空格可以恢復三點壓力或生命，可任意搭配
>交易 跟同格其他玩家交易裝備或卡牌，狀態不能交換，
>章節行動 紀錄在卡上，幫助你破壞儀式
2.抽神話卡 抽一張結算，沒特別敘述效果都只影響當前玩家，移動敵人則都找最短路徑，下方則如果有對應模型在供應區就放在對應顏色招換門
3.調查或戰鬥 如果你在沒怪地點就吃一張發現卡，結算中間效果根據選擇將卡插在左或右邊，有怪物就照你想要的順序結算，每個攻擊一次，此階段移動遇到的也會攻擊
*同伴可以代為承受傷害，但是不能回血，傷害滿就棄掉，增加技能的有該技能就升一級，不然就獲得一級技能
4.回合結束 結算回合結束效果，每個身上的火標記丟一顆黑骰結算，然後全部棄掉，神話卡棄牌庫如果有三張上方有招換邪神符號的，邪神模型或標記前進一格，根據階段卡或是章節卡結算效果，然後所有邪神卡洗回牌庫，如果邪神到達紅色格或是儀式被破壞，將階段卡1移到一旁(效果還在)開階段卡2結算效果，模型進場，使用邪神進程標記取代邪神模型，然後結算階段卡的回合結束效果，全部都要
*火標記不夠時，不加到場上，加到角色改直接造成傷害一點
*遊戲在任意玩家血量歸0或是神智歸0且邪神還沒進場就結束輸掉，進場則可以繼續，死掉腳色的卡牌都棄掉，該玩家回合只剩確認棄牌堆是否有三張邪神標記卡
*邪神攻擊時根據他的所有階段卡上顯示骰，只有儀式被破壞你才能攻擊他，每當你造成傷害超過此階段時將卡移到旁邊(超過的不會帶到下一張)，結算下一階段的展示效果，之前的所有階段卡效果仍在，但是血量只看還在圖板上的該張
*擊敗邪神的最後階段卡就獲勝，遊戲在進程標記到達第八格時也輸，或是邪神進場所有玩家都死亡也輸

That being said: EH, AH, etc. are also nothing like the stories which deal more with Being powerless against these elder beings and going insane at the glimpses into the vast unknown.  Most of the stories, taken literally, would make lousy games. :D

Game is fast paced with streamlined mechanics.  Sets up in about 15 minutes and plays (solo, at least) in about an hour.

The combination of the Greater Old Ones (bosses) and the episodes gives a lot of replayability (12 experiences in the core box).  I'm finding my win/loss rate is about 50%.  I think it may go down a bit as I made some mistakes in some of my earlier wins.

Biggest complaint is the tiles are a little small for the number of miniatures that can end up in a space.  Doubling their size still wouldn't be enough.

There are lots of interesting decisions regarding dice rerolls, which abilities to upgrade first, which enemies to attack, etc. However, the Lovecraft theme didn't come through especially well - the monsters are generally too easy to defeat, even though the game overall is hard to win.

Original (4) - during KS campaign: The minis (except the disgusting giant one) do look cool, but the game looks boring. Just how many times can you re-roll a die?? I like coops that force you to spend most of the game discussing and strategizing with your friends, not watching them roll dice over and over hoping for a tentacle to show up. The video playthrough made me wonder if I'll even want to try a friend's copy. I definitely won't be backing it."

486,Scaredy Dave,8,"This game is basically what I was wanting Mansions of Madness 2E to be. 

Its sorta like MoM2E, but not as complicated (meaning less fiddly bits, no 'millions of FFG card decks to rummage through', the board is made before play so no fishing for tiles mid game, no mini games, and all the content is used nicely, no ""buying a giant expansion to only use the big mini once"" issue, no app either!) mixed a bit with Horrified (being able to choose what monster to fight as your main bad guy before every scenario and also the gameplay varying depending which one you go with)

I like it because each scenario genuinely feels different, but its fast paced. Its definitely Pulp, don't go in expecting like a ""deep cosmic horror experience"", nope this is Pulp Cthulhu and high flying action against the Mythos. I play this mainly solo, I will say at solo, 2 investigators doesnt seem to be enough, Id only get about halfway through a scenario before dying. 3 is kind of the magic spot.

All in all, its my favorite Cthulhu themed BOARD game (my favorite Cthulhu themed CARD game is still Arkham Horror LCG and my favorite RPG is Call of Cthulhu) I like how it plays and its nice and simple to explain to newcomers, but still a decent challenge at 3 investigators (any more I have no knowledge of, I do hear maybe it can be too easy with 4 and above?) 

Its also my favorite CMON game because it actually uses all of its minis to full effect. No ""Rising Sun"" issue of having like 20 summons no one will ever use, they kept the actual minis down to the bare minimum needed to play and didnt over indulge in that department. I also have the Unspeakable Box and still didnt feel like they over did it with the minis. I dont normally like CMON games due to just ""too much for too little"", I feel like theyre either too gamey and take up too much space on my shelf. This one feels right though, just enough gamey-ness and theme and simplicity to be fun."

B) Because 10 vs 1 are 49-51 at this pοint so it is the fairest to do. If 10 counters get μore than 1s I'll change accordingly.
C) Because I can.
Other than that I'd like to state that I would not buy this one as I have enough CMON plastic for a whole kinder-garden to chew on.
 Also I would like to accuse CMON for promoting child abuse through their game. I would most likely use the giant Cthulhu to abuse kids if I had it.

Has some downtime (especially with higher player counts) due to players taking consecutive turns but it's inevitable in games like this and wasn't really a problem. I was afraid how this kind of co-op game would be received in my gaming group who usually enjoys playing mainly vs. or semi co-op games but after the play everyone loved it and wants to have another go."
508,Skitch_,N/A,"This game looks mediocre at best. The style of it doesn't appeal to me. I really dig the monsters but dislike the investigators. I don't have an issue with the way CMoN did the early bird pledges, I know a lot of people did and that is why they are rating the game low. CMoN is just doing what they do with Zombicide games for their stretch goals - a billion heroes (in this case investigators) that you will never play with.
I tried watching the gameplay video with Eric Lang but it was quite boring and I couldn't stand to finish it.  I doubt this will be a game I wished I had backed.
I wanted it to be good because I am just now dipping into Cthulhu mythos."

516,Soliddus,10,"An amazingly well crafted game, both in terms of mechanics and components, where the investigators need to resolve the puzzle for the scenario as they unavoidable fight with creatures from the Mythos. It creates deeply tense moments, and it has great replayability. It goes straight to my top games. It’s a delight both playing it and looking at the miniatures. CMON and Eric Lang, superb job!!"

521,spieleben,9.1,CDMD is a great fast paced game. But after seeing the bosses the first time they lack in deepness the second and eacht following time. Why? Because the boss cards are well known. And here comes my advice to CMON/E. Lang: Pleas offer diversive cards for the bosses. More variaty brings unpredictable setups in the lategame. Thats why i scale it 9/10. and not 10/10

529,steele22374,10,"After about a dozen plays from solo to 5 player, this has become my favorite game, period.  

Is there story, not with a lot of text, but every scenario leaves you with a story to tell.  Does it do justice to the mythos, I don't know, I don't like HP Lovecraft's writing enough to slog through the origins of the mythos.  And does it do everything you'd want a co-op, battle against the bad guys, game to do - yes!  (For me anyway.)

Each scenario feels completely different.  Each elder one also feels completely different.  And then you combine them and you have different squared. 

The characters all have one unique skill and then two skills that pull from a common pool of six (Marksmen, Brawling, Swiftness, Stealth, Arcane Mastery, and Toughness).  Put you have to push your characters to their breaking points to level up those skills.  The risk reward is palpable as you let yourself go a little mad to get stronger in the end.  At least until you go completely insane.

And that's how most games end, with someone (or someones) sacrificing themselves to take down the Elder One in cinematic glory.

Win or lose, you're on the razors edge the entire time.  I'd write more, but this is cutting into my play time..."

Teaching is maybe 5-10 minutes, setup is roughly 10 minutes, and our playtime has always been less than 90 mins.

Plus if you fail an Episode, resetting it takes only a minute.

Great Old Ones are difficult as they should be.

Plenty of scenarios though not very individualized with no actual tie ins to each like other cathulu games.

A musthave!"
545,tarlyn,8,"Great game. It is my 1st ""Cthulu"" purchase"
546,Tastya1ds,9.5,"This game is simple and doesn't try to hide it. Dice cruncher to the core with Cthulhu mythos on the front end. And you know what, is fun as hell. There is a lot of replayability, tons of characters to explore (the KS version worths it, every penny). The scenarios and bosses are well done and are very thematic, and the best of all, in all our gameplays there is only one thing in everyone mind. Sacrifices must be made.

Art & Components: Components (minis) are top notch as expected from CMON. The tiles are really neat, not so dark and really adds to the atmospheric setup. The box is awesome, the art, bu tthe quality was kind of meh. My copy has a huge hit on the bottom left corner, but hey, everything else is awesome, so no complains.


Gameplay: easy setup, easy rules, easy play. What I love the most is the leveling system, it really makes you think if you want to level up fast with the danger of ending crazy. The racetrack against the old one add tension to the game and I really love how you end everything in 1 very conclusive turn in which if you don't win, you get certainly that you will get f#$#%ed

Price: KS version is totally worth it"

549,the tickler,6,I really liked this game in the beginning. But after about 20 sessions I got bored. This game won't hit my table again in the near future.
550,theaaron,9,"Really fun, nicely streamlined co-op.

The level-up system is really well done. In lesser games, like Zombicide, leveling up is unsatisfying. In DmD, leveling feels spot-on. You level up at a good pace and you feel like your abilities increase to an appropriate level. A maxed-out ability feels almost too powerful, but at that point the enemies are also increasing.

My only complaint so far is that there can be too many abilities to track near the end of the game. Later in the game you have several Elder One cards in play that activate at different times, there might be tokens on the board that effect various phases, and you've got different enemies who each have their own effects. It can be a lot, and I doubt I've played a full game without making any mistakes.

With that aside, I just have to go back to the game being fun. It's easy to explain and start playing, which makes the late-game complexity more tolerable."

The range of characters, insanity conditions, monsters and options during play create a really compelling game with lots of choices and variety. Unusually for a cmon kickstarter this is actually decently playable with just the core box. Although the kickstarter-exclusive two part plastic trays for the player boards are almost essential. Hopefully someone will do 3rd party acrylic versions.

We all enjoyed the light-hearted take on Cthulhu. It edges out the otherwise very good Hellboy game by creating a better narrative during the game."

Despite having many games under their belt, CMON never seems to listen when it comes to fan disappointment. Early bird nonsense, kickstarter exclusive expansions, all the hate that HATE got, a ton of plastic but less detail on the actual gameplay itself (I'm looking at you Massive Darkness) and way too many investigators just like there are way too many Zombicide survivors."

Just note that, although I never played Zombicide, it's basically that with Cthulhu miniatures, not even theme. Cthulhu theme is non-existent, but it doesn't bother me as I am not a fan anyways.
Would not recommend you play a 5 player game, as what the player does is very minimal but then there's relatively a lot of upkeep, especially later on. so there's potential for tons of dead time. Being a cooperative you are always involved in the game, but being an alpha player is quite easy as all the information is readily available to all people at the table. 
This being said, the best games I had were at 3 players and 2 players with 2 characters each, the latter one being the absolute best.
Some conditions are completely worthless, others are so powerful they should probably not be in the game if you think balance. But in this game, murder is what you're looking for, and murder they give. Love it"

596,Wickdawg01,10,"Full review here: https://fuzzyllamareviews.com/2019/11/29/cthulhu-death-may-die/

Positive Final Thoughts 

Excellent gameplay and variable setups here. I simply love the way the player mats work with the actions and the insanity build-up. The miniatures look great and add a great deal to the overall presence of the game. The box storage is very cleverly done and for the most part the components are well done. The action gameplay here is second to none. 

Negative Final Thoughts 

The board tiles are much too small and the player mats without their holders are prone to knocking. Also, this game is EXTREMELY luck dependent. I mean I like some luck in my games to keep the tension up but this takes it to a whole new level. With having only five life, you need to make sure to always keep some Stress available for rerolls and make sure you keep the enemies thinned out a bit. There have been times I got a bad mythos card draw (is there any other kind) and 4 enemies moved into my space and proceeded to knock my head against a wall until I died (simulated). The game actually will end for everyone if a player dies before the elder god is summoned which tells me they designed the game this way just because of the wildly swingy luck factor."

If you have a bit of a twisted sense of humor and can roll with the bad times before falling into madness this will be perfect. If you have a way to get them all the expansion content and extra dice will be extremely useful for replayability and playability. Most characters will easily be rolling 6 dice before anything else weird. So you will be passing dice unless you have more.
