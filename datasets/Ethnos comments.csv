1,383cherokee,8,Ethnos  is a game I've wanted to get to the table for a long time. I finally got it to the table and I was excited of how well it turned out. The game is very simplistic. But the added mechanism of when you lay down a band of cards you have to put the rest of your hand out for somebody else to grab. The Third Dragon sneaks up on you very quickly.
2,AAAlone,7,Sadly my gaming group didn't care for this game which I found intriguing in its simple yet rich design.  Was not put off at all by components (as some were).
3,aaj94,4,"I really enjoyed Ethnos when I first played it, but as I've let it sit for a while I've really cooled on it. It's essentially Ticket to Ride with a pasted-on theme, and that's just not compelling enough to make a game great. Some people may find a lot of value in the accessibility, but the simplicity of the game makes it boring, not accessible. There's absolutely nothing to sink your teeth into here.

While the area control is rather interesting, I have plenty of other area control games that are not that much more complex, but far more satisfying than Ethnos, which is disappointingly linear and offers no way to move placed troops."

7,acanthus,8,Played today -- brilliant little game
8,Accatitippi,5.5,"I was hoping for a Ticket to Ride-ish area control game, but this is very very random, even considering that it's a set collection card game. This is partly due to the way the deck works, which forces blind draws; and partly due to the high value of bands, which promotes hoarding strategies. These are extremely effective if you're lucky, and terrible if you are not."

LIKE: Such a quick, smooth playing area control, and the subtle interactions are interesting. I like waiting for someone to play cards and reveal what they had been holding, so that I may be able to snag what I need. It's an interesting mechanism, but I'm not sure it's emphasied enough here. The variety of card powers really adds to replayability. 

DISLIKE: The card draws are a big luck element. The art is muddy and not easy to distinguish between cards. I enjoy seeing what other players surrender when they lay down a band, but it doesn't seem to happen often enough.

OVERALL: Good game for 3-5 player counts. The theme doesn't bother me at all. Has an ok game build across the eras, I wish there was more differentiation between the eras other than points. Not sure about longevity, as the card revealing isn't as tense as it should be."
13,adamscott,5,"An okay game that I would play again.  Ticket to Ride + Area Control + Hand Management.

Second play had a weird combo of races.  Down from 6 to 5.  Minimal desire to play again."
14,adamw,8,"Very good! It has elements of Small World I think - in the combination of races that 'break' rules. This surely also makes every game quite different each time you play. Turns just fly by so I suspect this supports a full table quite well. The single card draw is maybe the weakest part of play? But it does guarantee a fast pace. I like the push your luck feeling of seeing dragons come out and hoping you can get your cards to the table. The production is a bit challenging for color blind folks like myself - pastel playing pieces and no symbols for colors on cards (orange and green are especially troublesome). A bit more work here would have really lifted the game to the top for me. But still, very fun and fills an important niche in gaming given the player count and brisk play."

18,aesthetocyst,8,"Rating after initial 3 plays. This is like a better implementation of 504, that actually works, by offering flexibility, limited to a few areas. Mixing up races results in various game metas, some tight and muted, some dynamic and volatile. There is a lot of luck, which can result in very frustrating rounds. Thankfully, even with 6 players, the game moves VERY quickly, and can be completed in 60min. Alt rules for low player counts are offered. Rated an 8 based on the flexibility, potential for pimping and re-theming, will not rate higher at this time due to the high randomness and potential for frustrating player experiences. I don't think this one will get old. If it does, rating will drop."

Drafting / Area Control"
20,agentpatman,10,Very clever are a control card game. In a two player game the second age is a lot less important since you are unlikely able to get enough cards to control the area so clever card play comes in to just score then it use the powers to gain an advantage. The factions or races are very cool and play differently. Can't wait to try more combos of them to see how they change the gameplay. It's a simple game but enough choices to make tough decisions especially as you push your luck toward the end with the dragons or the 10 card limit. Definitely some take that as you need to be aware of what your opponent is going for in a two player game to make sure they don't complete the critical set they need to tip the area majority in their favor.

Scales very good for different player counts. It is also a quick game and easy to teach.
The twist: after you played cards, you have to discard all remaining cards in your hand which are then available for all players.

30,Akado,4,"Was an interesting game and had a lot going on for being pretty easy to explain.  Felt like there was a lot of blind drawing (randomness) but the game played fast enough that I didn't mind.

Would play again, but is not something I plan on owning due to having games I like at least as much."

32,alcofa,8,What a pleasant game!!! Good to play and very easy to teach and learn. Instant classic n my group
33,aldaryn,7,"First game had me concerned, we used all the simplest races. Used the opposite half game two. WOW, what a difference a 2nd game makes. One of the best of the year.

Would be a 10 if it wasn't ugly, and if the spatial relations on the map mattered AT ALL. "
34,aleemonaco,7,"Fun to play. It's a bit more simple than I was hoping, but I've only played 2-players. Enough to think about at first but it's become almost a bit too easy to figure out an ultimate strategy IMO. It's probably something I'll like when I'm a bit more brain-dead."
35,alenen,4,"1st play: I was not impressed by this game.  Some sort of area control mechanic with drawing cards from the deck blindly.  I'm told that with other champions it would be better, and playing with less than 6 it would be better.  It felt really random and uncontrollable with 6.

2nd play: We avoided the two champions that seemed to be problematic, and the game still didn't really work very well.  We played with 6 so maybe the game just isn't ideal at that count but scoring sets seems to be a lot stronger than scoring area majorities, though that could be group think."
36,alepsycho,7.5,"Good area control game, the mechanics are a little different from other area control games, and that brings a good refresh in this kind of game."
37,alexisW,4,"Using tried systems. This game brings those few elements and put it in a game. Rummy, set collection and Arena mixes reasonably well to come up with an area occupation game for victory points. 
It works till there. 
Theme wise is very weak. Battles are non existent. Countering your opponent is as good as delaying yourselves. All these added on will only bring this game to a level hovering along the waterline. 
Even for a filler or a light session. This game is weak."
38,Alexlimol,9.2,"Excellent game from Cool Mini or Not (probably from the ""Or not"" division, 12 races and not a single mini:) )It's an area control , but that is not the only, and perhaps not even the most important, aspect of the game. It's a card driven rummy-style design witha lot of points to be had from the groups of cards you play. Lots of variability as only six of the twelve races from the base box are used in a game. The games are incredibly different each time you play. can't Recommend enough."

49,AlphaEtOmega,N/A,"Pro:
- It's a card game aka my preference. :D

Reminder to self/info:
- Set collection type game
- 12 tribes, randomizer backing for which 6 in game
- End at 3 gaming segments/age -> 3 steps: draw card, deal 2 x players, split deck, put 3 dragons on bottom half, then rest on top,
- Age ends when 3 dragons are drawn
- 1 of 2 actions: recruit from ethnos store area, or play a band of allies -> same tribe or color -> pick a leader/place on top
- Each set = (if more then you have) is 1 control marker -> can use leader ability
- Discard hand into store area
- Most control tokens in region = VP, also bands created = VP for that age
- Control markers stay on board, collections reset

Want to play priority:
- 3 out of 5"

59,andy61,7,Quick-playing area control/set collection game where the selection of tribes adds a lot of variability to the game.  Success is still too dependent on card draw to rate it higher.
60,AndySzy,6,"Feels very ticket to ride ish. Set collection, play cards to score points, etc. One of my least favorite parts of TTR (but which is key) is the end game where you are stressing out about whether or not you'll get another turn - and this does that 3 times! I recognize that's an important gameplay element, but it stresses me out. Also: graphic design for this game is butt. Overall, a good game, but a step below ticket to ride for me."

63,Anifer15,10,"Awesome game. Simple to teach. Take a card or play a card. Works fine with 2 players. Our last game came down to the final play- my opponent was getting ready to play a huge hand and I was hoping to draw the last dragon card before he could lay down, and Iuckily I drew the dragon! Laugh out loud fun! There’s anticipation and race to gain points by owning the majority of chips on different worlds. Lots of replayability too given theres 12 tribes that each have their own special powers that give different feels to each game. Only one downside That people will complain about with this game is that it doesn’t look pretty but that doesn’t bother me."
64,AnnabelleD,8,Ethnos is FUN!  Players use the map to compete for area control and stack colored plastic tokens to designate area influence. The tension grows as the draw pile decreases and the dragon cards enter each round. The artwork and component quality deserve special praise and are a credit to this inexpensive game!

71,Apple Paul,7,"A simple, quirky and distinctive card driven area majority game, that played in a surprisingly breezy fashion with five. The card mechanics are straightforward and interesting, particularly the mechanic that requires one to effectively give away all the other unused cards from your hand, when playing a group of cards from your hand.  That simply ""give away"" rule makes for some original and interesting card play decisions.  And, curiously, we had a lot of fun with the three dragon card endings.

On the minus side, the theming of the game, the name (Ethnos?) of the game, and components (plastic?) in the game, deserved more work.  Was this game rushed to production?  Nevertheless, bottom line:  a simply amusing and distinctive game."

Only when you get about 9 or 10 cards on hand decisions took time. Overall the down time on this game is very fast paced. And sometimes it took less than 5 seconds before it was my time again. I highly recommend this game if you wish a light strategic game with some luck factor.

I played this back when I was first getting into gaming and it was the first game that made me feel like I was a ""real"" gamer. The mechanics of set collection + area control + the other add on's didn't make it feel like a ""kiddie"" game but they are simple enough to pick up quickly. 
You have to get sets of certain colors or characters, the leader character that you choose for your set will indicate which area you are going to inhabit. And each character has an added ability that you may want to use. (i.e the Wingfolk let you inhabit any colored region regardless of the Wingfolks color.)

106,Babbler,7,"There is a lot going for this game - I do like the premise of Rummy/Ticket to Ride card play combined with area control and special powers, but I have two problems with the game. First, the area majority score seems a bit off to me, but I could very well not be getting it. More importantly, when you complete a ""run"" (of the same rank or colour), you have to discard your whole hand to the display, which otherwise is not refreshed, as in Ticket to Ride. This is vastly inferior to Ticket to Ride, as it makes any strategy impossible and makes for round upon round of blind drawing from the deck, without much of anything (true, there's spam drawing in Ticket to Ride, but you can at least look at what your opponents are drawing, which provide some information for strategizing and some 'pseudo-interaction')."

It took us 90 minutes to finish the game and I think it's slightly more than the game should take (should be as the box says: 60 minutes). Maybe it's due to halflings which essentially add 12 more cards to the deck and prolong the game. What is more, I don't think I will ever play with halflings again. They also make players focus more on set collection than area control. The former is too much based on luck, whereas area control requires more skills and I'd rather there was more emphasis on it. On top of that - at least in our game - there were often moments when players just kept on blind drawing from the top of the deck hoping for something matching their band. Sometimes a player would play a band and discard 2 or 3 cards which were gone in a second. I don't know... after that first game seems too much based on blind draw. I'd rather there were more options to more consciously draw cards. And last thing: some races are really uninteresting at certain points. Trolls' tokens were gone fast and minotaurs seem not necessary in the first 2 ages. I've got to play it again without halflings, maybe with 3 players this time?"

119,bcnevan,6,"This game succeeds at what it is trying to be. Ethnos plays quickly (under an hour including setup), is easy to just pick up and play, plays at a wide range of play counts, and has lots of replay value in the combination of races. Overall, it is a very good game that fits the bill if you don't want something too weighty. 

Regarding the seemingly constant criticisms of this game's art/design, the pictures of the board/components make its art/design seem worse than it is. There's nothing wrong with the art/design of the game in person, as it's going for a classic/timeless look. It succeeds in that regard. The quality of the art work is high (without regard to whether one enjoys the setting or not) and the design of the board/cards is clean and functional. If anything, the tokens could have been a bit more sculpted on the bottom to assist in stacking stability, and the board could have been made a bit taller along the y-axis. 

Edit: Returned to this game after a big break. At least with 2 players, Trolls are pretty bad and only serve to up the already large component of luck. Downgrading for that reason alone.

140,Bigft64,8,"An excellent gateway+ style game. It takes the familiar mechanics of set collection and area control and gives it a couple new twists. One, when you play a set you also get a special power depending on the kind of card you choose as the ""leader"" of the set. Each game has 6 different cards in play with a total of 12 in the box so each game will play a bit different. Also, when you play a set any unused cards get discarded to the table where your opponents now have a chance to snatch them up. This means you want to build your set efficiently but building a big set can mean big windfalls for your opponents as you will likely have some unusable cards in the end. The production quality of the game itself is subpar by CMON standards since the board is rather small and the art is generic fantasy but it's all functional. Also the turns are super quick so you're only even taking a card or playing a set. Overall excellent game.

[i]Why This Is No Longer In The Collection:[/I] I got a good trade offer and decided to take it. Also the game tends to devolve into a top-decking luckfest (especially with certain factions in play) that seemed to swing the outcome too much. "

153,BlueDane,5,"I'm still undecided how I feel about this game. It's an area majority game that utilizes cards in a clever manner. 

The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that at certain moments the cards on display were non-existent and top-decking or just drawing the top card was prevalent.

For example, in my first play, an opponent played all of his cards and top-decked (drew cards from the top of the deck that were very beneficial to him) a number of cards that synergized incredibly and played a fantastic hand on his next turn winning the game. That type of luck doesn't appeal to me in games.

Anyways, the jury is out and I would like to play it again if just to formulate a more concise opinion. "

+ Just plain fun.
+ Every game is different since you pick 6 races out of 12 for every game.
+ Making the rest of your cards available to other players when you play a band. This opens up options for everyone around the table.
+ The tension of pushing your luck when you know the dragon is about to come up.
+ Balancing set collection as well as area-control so well in such a simple little game.

What I dislike:
- The theme is terrible. It's dorky and makes it hard to bring it out on family gatherings because it gets judged by it's cover. This should have been a Days of Wonder game.
- So much potential for expansions, but nothing so far.

[s]Provisional rating after one play.[/s] An easy game to teach that has the simplicity of a Ticket to Ride game, but instead of connecting routes you're playing an area majority game on a map. While you have hidden objectives in TtR, the spice in Ethnos comes from special abilities of certain cards.

Pacing of turns is fast but there's too much luck of the draw for my tastes. Most of the cards are drawn blindly, which means fate decides a lot and you don't get to know what others have collected. Added to that; In a game of TtR you see the game coming to a close and you always get to do one last turn. Not so in Ethnos. With some bad luck the game could be over without any signal beforehand, which can be a big point swing.

The game mechanics could cater a wide audience but the theme and graphics will probably deter a lot of potential players. Which is a shame, because this would otherwise be a fine gateway game. 

(Yes, I'm referring to Ticket to Ride a lot, because in my mind it shares a lot of its properties.)"

188,btasam,2,"Ethnos has always been presented to me as TTR with area control and honestly, there is a lot of truth to this comparison. Unlike TTR though, the mechanics are more restrictive: only drawing a single card and discarding the rest of your hand after playing a set. Sadly, this means that the majority of your turns are spent drawing (roughly 4/5 turns are spent drawing in most playthrough videos). 

While I understand that part of the enjoyment of Ethnos is exploring the tribe synergy and developing strategy around what's available, I cannot overstate just how frustrating the gameplay feels. Even being able to draw and play on the same turn would have been an improvement but seems more like a missed opportunity."

Decisions are tough, as you either wait, hoping for better cards, or play your hand, giving cards up to opponents, in order to gain presence on the board or activate an ability. 

It's so nice to see designers making card-driven games without just plugging card drafting into the design as a lazy way to ""self-balance"" the card powers.  I'm also pleasantly surprised by how well this game works with only two players (unlike most area-control games). Really hoping there's a sizeable expansion in the works for this."

The unique combinations of races and the randomness to what cards happen to be available keeps you on your toes every time and the pace of the game is fast. I really like the balance between playing larger bands of cards for more points or playing more smaller bands for dominance on the board. Plenty of tactical decisions."

224,cfarrell,4,"Weird game; this has gotten some love with my Instagram and Geek buddies, but our game felt like there was almost nothing going on - the draft pile got quickly exhausted and then everyone was just drawing from the deck blind;the pool rarely refreshed so you rarely made interesting choices. I think part of this was that we had both the Elves and Centaurs in play, both of which allow you to utilize a lot more cards without discarding, but, uh, you are supposed to test for that stuff, right? Then the late game got sclerotic because useful plays become both quite limited and hard, as you’ll have only a couple provinces where your play matters and you’ll need 4 of a kind to manage it when you’re just drawing blind most of the time.

It was really weird. It felt like there were pieces of an interesting game here, but they just hadn’t been put together. Either that, or the various combinations just weren’t vetted well enough. If the play time had actually been 45-60 mimutes it would have been OK but at 90 the opportunity costs are really high.

Anyway, it’s inoffensive enough and easy to play, so there’s that at least. But tough to recommend."

227,cgs_raverboy,7.3,Ethnos is a quick set collection / area control game where each players play their cards in hand while keeping an eye of the end of game card.  Pretty easy gameplay: collect the same colored cards or type (race) of cards; get 6 if possible and actually play them to trigger some unique special abilities and score points. I like how the game gives you a chance to pick your early and mid-game strategies based on the type of cards on the board. It's a very high replayability game for me.

233,charlest,6.4,"This is an enjoyable Euro area control experience. It's about building sets to deploy control markers to the board but it has a nice tension in pushing your luck via drawing from the deck. It also has a very interesting hand mechanism where you discard every card that's not in your set. This pushes strategy towards maintaining efficiency and maximizing your set construction via the action economy.

There's lots to like here and this game has gotten quite a bit of hype because of it. There are definitely downsides though. First of all, the overall graphical presentation is lackluster. Secondly, and more importantly, the game really suffers from avoiding conflict. It's a very passive aggressive experience without direct conflict or interesting social connections made with other players. It's less interactive than something like Tyrants of the Underdark or Godfather: The New Don, which keeps it from elevating itself from good to great.

Also not too enamored with the constant drawing of cards from the deck when the display runs out. This leads to swingy outcomes in an unfun and arbitrary way.

I would not turn this game down and I enjoyed myself while playing, but it's also not something I have to own or need to get played. The process of play simply doesn't produce memorable moments or great drama."

I finally got a chance to play the game, and I like it. I like how fast the turns move around. I also like the variability of the different races. We were close to running out of tokens for the cyan player (we were using the Merfolk and the Orcs). Even though I'm missing two pieces, it seems like there are enough markers that it won't make a difference."
237,chearns,8,"To start with, the drawings on the cards are boring generic fantasy, no soul to them whatsoever. The graphic design on the cards seems to actively hate me. It's functional, but ugly.  The chips are okay looking, but not evocative at all, however, in terms of functionality, they are very slippery and so the towers fall easily when knocked or adding chip. You need a good memory to play this game to remember where the chips are supposed to be if a chain reaction happens knocking several towers over at once. The board, on the other hand, I find pleasing to look at. I would love a better designed production of this game. Something that is both better looking and more functional.

That being said, the game is good enough to overcome these massive shortcomings. It is my favourite kind of area control. There is only building and no tearing each other down. The special powers on the cards introduce some interesting aspects to consider and can have quite the impact on how the game plays out for they are not all equal and some can encourage different types of strategies."

But this is a surprisingly fun game that plays smooth yet offers enough decisions to keep it interesting. There's great tension in the decision of how dedicated you want to be toward a particular set, as inefficient set collection means everyone else gets to benefit from extra cards that you dump on the table.

Factor in the variability of playing only 6 out of 12 race powers in any given game, and this one looks like it has some real staying power.

This is an ideal lunchtime game with coworkers. Reliably plays in under 60 minutes, tons of variability over time, easy to teach with streamlined turns."

First, it seems after the initial round setup cards are so rarely added to the face up display it increases the amount of blind draws and really takes away the fun and any sense of strategy the game may have. Second, you can't move into new areas with your existing pieces you only build up in an area. Part of the fun of area control to me is moving around and being able to attack others, that doesn't really occur here. Finally, it seems to fit in that space where of too many rules for gateway gamers and not enough depth for gamers. If I want an area control game of this weight I'd go with King of Tokyo. Combine those things with the very drab artwork and you have a game I'd play but likely not one I'd suggest."

Turns are a breeze: either draw one card or set down an army of cards with matching colors or matching races. That's it. Players can always count on their turn coming up again in short order because there's so little to do. It's a lot like ""Ticket to Ride"" in that regard, only there's more here to consider.

To be honest, I did have fun in my one play, but that was mostly a function of who I played with (mostly non-gamers). If I took this to game night, I'm pretty sure it would get the Gong. It has one my pet peeves where the start player both has a turn order advantage, AND possibly more moves that other players (game does ensure equal number of turns). The also degenerates a bit, where it starts with a fairly large draw pool of cards, but it evaporates, leaving players with sometimes no choice at all. Feels a little weird. I do like the variety, though. So, extra point for that."

IMPORTANT: Rating of 8 is for the game with the following popular house rule:

""When drawing from the deck, instead take 2 cards.  Choose 1 to put in your hand and put the other into the common market.""

This simple change *drastically* opens up the strategy and interaction space.  Otherwise the common market gets rapidly depleted and then you feel like you're playing Bingo off the top.

Would be 6.5 without that house rule."

I just really wish that it wasn't so random--the distribution of the draw deck is such that it's not impossible to draw exactly what you need but it can nevertheless leave some players drawing pointlessly for many turns and then ultimately dumping the fruits of their misfortune into the market for the other, more fortunate players to hoover up.

As for gameplay, there really weren't many interesting decisions to make. The cards play you, so you don't really have much agency. I'd estimate that about 85% of the turns were players drawing a random card off the top of the draw pile.

380,DroppEcho,9,"An area control game (at heart) driven by a rummy engine.  (Thurn and Taxis is a good comparison here).   There is a nice mix of races and abilities.   I was a little disappointed with the amount of ties that occur in scoring, but perhaps more players and/or Trolls will solve that.   Plays very quickly, but there can be (not always) a crap-ton of top-decking that is going to be contentious for some players.   Has stood up to multiple plays without getting old - the variability is excellent.  (Pro Tip:  remove the Elves from the game, they break the utility of the card display.)

The game has gotten hammered for the graphical presentation, and I think that is unfair.  Yes, it has a very dated early 90s look....  but I think that feels fresh at this point in gaming where every single Mayfair/Lookout game looks EXACTLY THE SAME.   I'm sick and tired of cartoon figures with heavy shading gradients.  Blech.   Ethnos slaps that in the face.  The John Howe artwork is fantastic.   The corner icons on the cards would be more clear without the triangle frame - that was a bad choice by CMON.   Same goes for the cool-looking plastic bits.  They don't stack well and are pretty unstable.   That's not really excusable for a plastics-based company to get that wrong.   The colors are awesome, though.

David Doust - if you see this, you still owe me $80 from New Wave unfulfilled orders.  I have avoided CMON games up until now for that reason, but Ethnos drew me in."

Two-player game. Won by one point!

I didn't expect this to be good at all at two players. being an area-majority game but the two-player rule is really good.

This has been my third play of Ethnos and it has really grown on me. My first play was a totally disaster and left me with a complete dissatisfaction with the game. 

The two-player game has very minor changes in the scoring and placing, so it's still a familiar game but unfortunately at two-player to me is TOO intense for my taste. 

I felt that it's too long with two-player but then I found that the length turn out to be okay. 

I really like the game but wouldn't buy it because I think it will not suit with my gaming group. It's amazing how the different factions do totally different thing but mesh all together SO WELL."
389,duckworp,6,"[thing=206718][/thing] has been heralded as a new Ticket to Ride, an area majority gateway game.  It is a little too complex to be a true gateway game, and has a truly dreadful generic fantasy theme which would make any non-gamers I know run a million miles.  

(Personal rant time: When will publishers begin to realise that the general public do not like Fantasy?  If you want a game to have broad appeal in a wider market use a theme people can relate to.  This game could be animals in a forest, nations on a map, groups of people in coffee shops, anything would be better than what is presented here.  I know in the world of BGG Fantasy is a popular theme, but believe me, it does not resonate in the wider world.) 

The game play is smooth, if rather bland.  All the rough edges have been rounded off to the extent that there is not a lot of bite left. The artwork and components are appalling, with cheap plastic bits and an uninspiring map on the board.

Nonetheless it is has much to recommend it: it is short (an hour or so), turns go very quickly so it plays with 6 with little downtime, and there are enough decisions to make it interesting, if ultimately there is too much luck to make it [i]that[/i] interesting."

As often noted, the graphic presentation is off, though mostly functional. One challenge is that the different races on the cards are not easily differentiated."

414,Eeeville,6,"Many people call Ethnos the Ticket to Ride of Area Control games. While I understand that sentiment, I still feel Web of Power is more apt to that description. I think Ethnos' best aspect, is the fact that the game comes with 12 races which distinctly change the game and you only use 6 each game. This makes the replay value of this game massive. Additionally, it makes the game easily expandable. The turns are simple. You just draw a card or play cards. There is a nice feeling of push-your-luck tension near the end of each age. I say this because there are 3 dragon cards at the bottom of half of the deck and when the third dragon is drawn, the age immediately ends. Though, there are some aspects that I'm not so fussy on. First, when all the cards have been drafted from the display, you draw random cards from the top of the deck. This happens quite often, making the luck of the draw quite pronounced. Second, the map and graphic design are pretty mediocre. I do love the illustrations however. I think this is going to be a great gateway game for some people. For me, it's good but not great."
415,eimative,6,"Ethnos is essentially a set collecting card game with two suits and card abilities unique to each suit. Play is quick and has a great push-your-luck or bust element. Everything works for a clean card game, so it is too bad this needed a board to play for the added territory control scoring. I'm not against this, but egads the look of the board and garish card desgin took my rating down a notch.

In the end, Ethnos is solid to play, but I wasn't sure it offered much beyond other smaller and cheaper card games."
416,Eisenkreuz,9,"One of the best area control games of all time. The theme is a bit weird and its easy to get confused on the race abilities. Replay-ability is fantastic! If the theme worked a little better, I'd rate this a 10."
417,Eiska,4,"I wanted to try to play this game as I knew it was quite high on BGG Rank list. I still was pretty surprised about how light and heavily luck-driven game this actually is, even if I had been warned about it. 

In our 6-player game, the market was almost always empty. So our most usual action was to take a blind card from the deck. That was very dull. Usually I didn't get any useful cards, and it was not possible to exchange them any way. And you really cannot do very much anything during your turn, as you either draw a card or place a set of cards in front of you on the table. If you made the latter one, then you also place some marker on the game board and discard all extra cards from your hand. So you need to start that slow card collecting process from the very beginning again, if you were not lucky to play a race that saves your cards in your hand.

Maybe this game would make more sense to play with less than 6 players. It would need at least some permanent market, so that players wouldn't be forced to take blind cards. However, there is too much push-your-luck for me.

I wonder how this kind of game ever can be so high in BGG Rank?"

Normally I would personally love the bright colors and shapes of the player pieces but it doesn't match up with the player board or cards and the connection between the races and their abilities is weak thematically.

504,Gamer_Dog,3,"This game's essence, is rummy. A wonderfully new interpretation of it, but it's still, a card drawing game. If you like waiting on lucky card draws, trying to decide when to cut your losses or whether your discards will help others, this game is for you. 

On the plus side:
*In addition to set collection, there's also an area majority mechanic that is significant. It requires ever luckier draws to get the area majorities, but it adds a risk/reward element to your decision
* Suits have powers that affect what you are trying to get
* Some suits or suit combinations mitigate or improve upon the rummy aspect
* Turns should be quick
* Replayability is high
* Expandability is high, and I'm sure they will do this

On the down side:
* Cards are very poor quality, which is a horrible thing in a card game. Add sleeves to the price if you're considering buying.
* Cards are not very well designed to see at a glance the two aspects (region/faction)
* The luck aspect is pretty significant. By the second age, you'll typically be waiting for a usable card once your hand takes shape
* Some starting suits or suit combinations work poorly and strip down the game rather than augment it
* Takes a lot longer than 3 hands of rummy, and requires some set up/tear down

Overall, this is a much-enhanced version of rummy, which I don't really enjoy. The enhancements add depth, and play time, without mitigating the weaknesses very well (although some combinations of starting factions actually work well together). As a light card game, you almost need sleeves because of the poor card quality, so it's pretty expensive for what it is. Still, there's a game here, and if this kind of card game is your thing, I could recommend you check it out even though it's not to my taste."

I wanted to like this game. I like area control, I like fantasy. But what I don't like is too much luck. And this game is 80-90% luck. For example, the centaur card lets you play another card, it's like you get another turn. If you're not lucky, you never get one and have several turns less than others. This game is just about drawing cards, luck, luck, luck, yuck!

There's no interaction, you can't kick someone out of an area.

522,GeorgW,6.5,"EDIT: After 10+ plays this game is starting to show its flaws. The turn order advantage is way too impactful, most games play out the same and the area control part of the game is simply much weaker than the big band portion due to the point reward from areas being too low. The last point is the one that made me lower its rating, because the ""correct"" way to play this game is to just keep hoarding cards until you get big bands, which is not that interesting or interactive and is also more luck-driven than all of the other aspects of the game.

This game kills Ticket to Ride for me. They both have cards of different colours with a central market and you play cards to advance your position on a board. Ethnos differs by managing to get rid of the things that I find most annoying in TtR. There's a hand limit, so you don't sit around with 30 card hands. The market row isn't random, it's made up by the cards your opponents discard. All points are open, so you don't get blocked by random. Above all, the cards have several uses, so you're never stuck with an entirely useless hand. 

The rules are simple yet the game has depth. It plays super quickly, turns take 5 seconds and you can easily play the game in 30 minutes. The card play isn't particularly unique or interesting and the area control part is very basic, but combined together with the many different special powers and the undetermined age length it all forms a wonderfully engaging game. With this and Libertalia, Paolo Mori is quickly becoming my favourite designer.

My one complaint and the reason I don't have it in my collection is that the art design is flat out ugly. Sure, I didn't notice it quite as much while playing and it is functional, but the bright neon player discs on the drab, tiny map and the cards with serious art pasted on top of a rectangle of colour with no attempt at all to make those rectangles interesting just feels wrong.

536,Givmigspiltiljul,N/A,"Ethnos is quite good and I realy want to play it again. 
It's like Ticket to ride with very fast turns and card drafting. If you gave the different colours of wagons special powers and put in some area control, Ethnos is pretty much what you get. Because the turns are so quick , people often get surprised that it's already their turn again, so  it's important to have someone looking out for whos turn it is. I think the action going on on the board itself is less exciting than ticket to ride, but the special powers on the other hand makes up for it."

539,glanfam,9,"plus Faeries expansion
its greatness is that it is easy to teach and scales well at all counts"
540,glax,7,"It's a well-designed game. Very abstract with theme completely pasted on. The push-your-luck mechanism when taking cards has some interesting dynamics, especially toward the end of the game, but ultimately is less interesting than I had hoped. There isn't that much of a feel of having to worry about what opponents will do with your discards because just trying to achieve your own goals seems to override most other considerations. It would be nice if there were some compensation for the gamble of taking cards and receiving something that you can't really use; as it is, it feels like a lost turn when it happens.

My main knock against the game is that it is ultimately very hard to to get into your hand the cards you want—which is an odd choice for an area control game based on playing cards. The band mechanism balances that out a bit and does offer an alternative VP path, but overall it's fairly random with a predominantly tactical feel, which is fine for what it is and for its length. The key to the game seems to be to play reactively with what you are able to muster rather than trying to plan ahead too much."

542,Glic2003,8,"Every time I see the box cover for this game I think, ""Oh yeah, that sweet game about fantasy races battling to the death... awesome!""  Then someone opens the box and I groan, remembering  what the game actually is.   

It's not that Ethnos is a bad game.  Its game mechanics can actually be very sharp and fast.  It's a good, lean design.  The problem is, it's just such a bland, ugly game that I can never get excited about actually playing it.  The gorgeous box art looks like a fantastic game of fantasy battles, but the actual game is just set collection and placing really lame ""control tokens"" on the board.   The oversized rulebook, filled with distracting quotes from the various fantasy races involved in the ""battle,"" is just embarrassing.   

Some of the games I enjoy are a triumph of style over substance.  Ethnos is like the opposite of that.   It's like kids flailing cardboard swords at each other shouting ""we're having a battle!""  No, you're not.  You're playing Ticket to Ride."

546,glutealgeometry,9,"Great go-to when u find yourself with 6 players. The occasional obsessive player can go into momentary analysis paralysis on the occasional turn, but for the most part there's very little downtime.
If you're convinced this game is mostly luck you're not THINKING hard enough! Try: planning further ahead which countries you wanna dominate in later ages, figuring out the strongest racial power your opponents are neglecting, & ESPECIALLY maximizing your chances by looking around the table to see how much of which colors &races are no longer available because your opponents have already included them in bands! Sure, the cards can still screw you... it's a freakin CARD game, folks! But there's a LOT you can do to mitigate that luck.
I'm not in love with every combination of races (factions? I fergit what they're called in this one) but an experienced enough player or group can spot & modify awkward combos before play begins. The main 2 are:
1) Elves & Centaurs... because both minimize discards, so you end up with WAY fewer face-up cards after the initial layout, increasing the randomness resulting from blind drawing.
2) Skeletons & Halflings... because neither have tribal powers, making the game much more boring."

That, and a re-theme, are my only nitpicks. The game is accessible and smooth to play. The teach can be a bit rough depending on what factions are in play as people sometimes don't get how the bands work and how you need to play 1+ card more than your current presence in a region, but after the first round it clicks and plays fast.  If this game had a better table presence, I think it would have been a much bitter hit than it became."

565,greglios,7,I'm not typically a fan of area control games but the set collection aspect and the way the scoring changes over the course of the game make this one pretty interesting
566,gregoriomagno17,8,"For those who are skeptical of its fantasy genre, the box art will do it the most disservice.  It plays as a game that could well be played with people who don't like the fantasy genre, and for those who are looking for it, it will contain enough fantasy to keep them entertained; but this game is area control simplified down to a very simple core: Pick up a card and put a marker on the board.  This is a gateway game to draw new people into the hobby, but a box art filled with pictures of werewolves and skeletons might just unfairly push them away."
567,Grey Pilgrim,8,"Ethnos is a card game where players will play sets of cards in an effort to apply those sets to certain regions of the board, gaining majority control in each territory. What it adds are plenty of interestingly direct decisions (push luck for a larger set vs play now for majority token) that both offer interesting decision points while still offering player turns that whip around very quickly.  Here is a constant choice between a powerful ability or going for territory control for a good deal of points. Ethnos' art can be a hard sell, and it can be difficult to see what makes the game such a good time to play. This game is one of the few that play well and very quickly at all player counts, offers the same wonderful tension of ability benefit vs points benefit, and has the feel of a race to play before the deck is diminished--something Paolo Mori does very well in his designs. It scales very well and is worth playing. Regarding the art, it is commonplace to see it as a detractor, but John Howe gives a positive sense of nostalgic ties to his earlier work for Lord of the Rings. The game compares nicely to the charming Ticket to Ride, but the twists are enough to allow it to stand on its own ground. Ethnos is a great game, often sneaking itself into the play pile and leaving players unsuspectingly satisfied with the play afterwards."

A great, not particularly expensive game that should maybe have been a little bit more expensive to give us better components (I like the plastic tokens, but the board and particularly the points track is way too tiny, unacceptably so).
Anyway, a great game that plays well with 4+ players (up to 6, which is 1 more than TTR)."
571,gskillman,7,"Put Colossal Arena, Alhambra and Rummy into a pot. Apply heat and stir."
572,GSReis,6.5,"Enjoyable game with familiar mechanics of area control and set collection. The rules are surprisingly simple and elegant: on your turn, take a card or play a set. When you do the latter, you must discard the rest of your hand to the open pool, from where any players can take them. The various races with their unique special powers add interest and, as you use only half of them per game, replayability. However, luck of the draw is huge and potentially decisive, as the open pool is empty most of the time, forcing players to draw blindly from the deck, with no way to mitigate randomness. The game seriously needs a variant imposing a minimum number of open cards at all times."
573,Guiannos,6.8,"First impression rating: good game, not a great game. It plays quickly and the depth is just about right for the length. Different races/factions look like they will add enough replayability for most players but I'd need a couple more games under my belt to decide for sure."
574,GuidoVanHorn,8,Solid gameplay. Needs an expansion
575,guillemrobi,8,"Simple and straight forward area control. The variabilty of races really adds to the replayability. It's like the typical grandmother's dish, it doesn't look great, it isn't sofisticated, but everytime you eat it, you enjoy it.

Sometimes we just play this game without saying a word (like chess or domino), and not in a bad sense, it doesn't produce any AP, any stress, just playing with music.

I feel like it could be a 7 for some people, as much replayability it has for all the races, but each one of them lacks of deepness. But for me, it fills the gap that I needed, 8."

Update: of all the races, I think the Centaurs is the race that can make the game way more random, simply by the fact that fewer cards get ""discarded"" to the market for others to choose from. Basically this makes the luck of the draw from the draw pile very much an issue... Lowering my rating 0.5 because of this..."

I love the variability of the different races and how you can see their theme in their special rules.

621,HypnoticSpecter,7.5,"The game is mostly good. Very light, family weight area control/set collection game. After repeated plays however, I have started to see some of the flaws in the game. The game is heavily dependent on luck, much more than I like. You have one of two actions you may play during your turn: Draw 1 card, or play a band. Problem is, in the draw pile you have three dragons cards, and once the third is drawn, the round ends and you must discard any unplayed cards. So if you were holding out for a huge band, you may get shafted.  

You are at the mercy of the draw pile, and yes when other players play bands the cards you need may show up, but what are the chances for that. But even with that the game is short, and is very easy to learn, which makes it still a ""good"" game. However I think I need something with just a little more punch, and more control."
622,iamzimmer,6.9,"It's not a really exciting game, but it is certainly a worthwhile suggestion if you're wanting a game that can play 6 people because it fits the bill fine for that.
The main reason keeping this game from being rated higher IMO is how inevitably everyone will be just drawing cards from the top of the deck (because there is no options in the display) so there is a high luck element. The good thing though is that the game moves VERY quickly, even with 6 players (because it is either ""draw a card"" or ""play a set & discard the rest"" on your turn).
The different cards add a nice variability for replays."
623,Ibaimendi,7,"I don't think this is the title I would have chosen for this?
But I liked this game.  Players try to create sets of cards, but are limited by the strict hand limit.  However, the cards are different fantasy peoples who have different powers that affect the game in various ways (and there are lots of different decks, which probably helps replayability).  There's a board with some area control on it too, but it's really the card play that makes the game interesting.
The rhythm of the game is unusual and imperfect.  Players can take cards to their hands or play cards from their hands, so at some times during the game, it's mainly just drawing cards and trying to build up your hand. However, there's also some incentive to get your sets out early, and I think that works out well. (1 play)"

For a CMON game, the production value is disappointing. 

The graphic color choices are fine for all but the colorblind, but the background texture used should have been varied for each color. The logos for each race are rendered indistinguishable at a distance due to the triangle framing of each icon. The illustrations are technically proficient, but the printing is washed out and lacking in contrast, making most tribes look similar in tone, again, minimizing their distinctiveness.

A better Ticket to Ride. You can actually INTERACT with your opponents by contesting the areas they control, and the cards you pick can be used in multiple ways, making for more interesting decisions on each turn.

My favorite part of the game is at the end when I get to participate in an [url=https://i.giphy.com/media/Nv2bW1GVgNn5m/giphy.webp]Ethnos cleansing[/url]"

Despite being so different in terms of racial abilities, the 12 races are quite balanced. Every race felt overpowered which in itself balances each other out. High recommended."

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2018)

I have disliked every Cool Mini or Not game I have played (with the possible exception of Xenoshyft, the jury is still out on that one) so I wasn’t expecting much from Ethnos. The reason I bought it was the designer, Paolo Mori, which I respect a lot. Every game I have played from him has had some interesting feature and Ethnos is no exception.

The rules of the game are easy to grasp and teach, you can teach them under 6 minutes. Playtime is, surprisingly, fast. Even with 6 players, there is almost no downtime.

One thing I have come to expect from CMON is the high quality of their games, but here, they dropped the ball. The board is way too small and ugly. The art of the cards is functional, but nothing special. The player´s pieces are merely ok, but they are unstable. I’m very surprised by this.

The theme is really cool, but sadly, it is pasted on. You really don’t feel it in the game.

Gameplay is very fun. At first I was very engaged with the game. You will play for 3 rounds and at the beginning here are many cards to choose from but after a couple of turns you will have to draw from the deck and luck will decide which card you will get (this bothers me a lot and it is the deal breaker for me). The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard making Ethnos a family level game. Either you play your hand or you draw another card. When you play your hand you will discard the cards that you didn’t play. This is a neat feature.

There are 12 races in the game and you will only use 6 in each game, each race has a different power. I love this feature in games. The relationship between the races will be different most times and it is easily expandable. It also makes the game highly repayable.

The luck factor is high. When you lose a position, there is no way to attack again if the cards don’t help. When you have options of which card to draw the game is great, but when you have to blindly draw from the deck (as most times) the game is boring.

Another issue is that the first players have a definitive advantage as the round ends immediately. This means the first players will have (more likely) more turns than everybody else. I didn’t see any way to mitigate this and I feel it is very unfair.

When you attack a player, it doesn’t really feels like an attack, that is, you don’t feel the game is mean and that’s weird in an area control game. I prefer games to be this way.

Bottom line, Ethnos is among the best CMON games I have played, but the luck factor is too much for me. I already sold my copy of the game. I would play again if requested as I kind of liked it. I´m very glad the game moves at a fast pace so the 2 big issue I have with the game can be (barely) forgotten. Perhaps with 2 players the luck factor would be reduced. The graphic design leaves a lot to be desired and that’s very weird coming from CMON. It can be a good family game or it can serve as an introductory game for new gamers. It is mostly a tactical endeavor.

Current Rating: 5.0"
674,jgunnz,6.75,"Nice idea, I think the fact that there are several scoring modules and not all are used combined with race powers makes this game interesting. I would rather play this than ticket to ride - and I put them in the same category.  I am not a fan of the art style and graphic design of this game - seems very disjointed especially for a CMON production. "
675,jholder29,8,This game took me a while to warm up to. Get past the theme and there is a great game here!
676,Jim Marshall,8,"Simple mechanics are easy to explain and understand, but the decision making has the right degree of challenge for the game weight and length.

Multiplayer works well as the turns are short. the game has a cyclical tempo, with a number of turns f focused just around drawing cards before sets are played and the draw pool fills up with cards.

Rivals Arboretum for the best use of a discard mechanism in a game."

679,jjacjackson,8,"Solid, light gateway using set collection (Ticket to Ride) as the mechanism for placing area majority. The various creatures provide fun additions to these collection aspect yielding higher replayability. Turns are simple - draw a card OR pay a set. Moves quickly keeping most games under an hour (even 5-6 players). While it's a bit light to make a top 10, it's a fantastic way to end the night if only an hour remains."

688,jmmccook,6.5,Really wanted to like this more than we did.  We actually played this before we ever tried ticket to ride. We prefer ticket to ride so much more than this.

689,jmoline,8,"2017-06-03 - I've only played this once, but I really enjoyed it. It's simple and very fast, but interesting. The push your luck element of collecting cards (especially towards the end of a round) is a lot of fun, too. Definitely looking forward to playing more.

690,jnharr,7,"Ethnos is an interesting blend of set collection and area control, both of which are viable scoring avenues in the game. The theme of this game could really be anything (medieval lords, sci-fi, etc.), but the game itself is satisfying enough that you can overlook how thinly implemented the theme is. The various mix of factions and abilities makes for immense replayability. The brief play time and simple rules make Ethnos a nice choice for a lighter group game."

694,joelpetersen,9,"A family game that also works as a gamers game. Great variance with the different tribes. The board could definitely have been a lot bigger and the tokens less weirdly coloured, but the tokens stack very nicely. I would recommend this to almost everyone (at least for 4+ players)"
695,joewyka,7,"At first I was struck by how similar Ethnos was to Ticket to Ride. Draft a card or play a set are your basic choices. You play sets in order to place a token in one of six regions. Sets either have to match color or race and the top card becomes the ""leader"". Typically, the color of the leader matches the region where your token goes. However, every race has a different ability that activates when you make them the leader. This can influence placements or points and many races have a sub-game on the side which can be another source of points. The game is divided into three eras, after each is a majority scoring by region and players score their played sets: bigger sets = more points. The deck is shuffled between eras, but tokens stay on the board, so the long play is the majority game.

In Ethnos the turns are fast, the thinking is pretty simple, but the racial abilities give you real options as to who you are going to have lead each set and why. Point values of the regions are randomly set up by era, so some regions can be valuable from the get go, some are low value until the end and some are never all that valuable. The variation of region scoring and races in play give Ethnos decent replayability. I can break this out with serious and casual gamers. I'm starting this out at a 7, but I could see this rising to an 8 with more play. If the audience for this is a broad as I suspect, it won't take long to get there."
696,John Rogers,2,Area control ticket to ride with decent fantasy art but a HORRIBLE color scheme (I can’t tell between the colored areas on the board). So much of this is dependent upon luck of the draw and once you fall behind there really is little to nothing you can do about it (draw better I guess?). Not sure why so many people like this. One of the worst games I have ever played.

703,johnpnewman,6.5,Ethnos is a simple area control/set collection game.  It had potential.  I enjoyed my first play or two.   What kills the game for me is that you are often relegated to drawing blind in a set collection game.  That  is a poor design choice.   There needs to be an automatic reset of the open cards at some point.  Too many gateway games that are much better.

708,JoSch,8,"How can a new game look so old-fashioned in 2017? Every average Kickstarter game looks far better than this release. The gory illustrations by John Howe are a huge mismatch to the drab gameboard and the otherwise functional graphics. 

Once beyond these stumbling blocks, Ethnos is a solid eurogame; a smooth mix of set collection, push-your-luck and area majority. Players try to collect sets in rummy-style. The trick is that they are allowed to collect a maximum of ten cards before having to play a set and then discarding the rest of their hand to the center display. This display is quickly emptied and not refilled from the draw stack. Thus, drawing blind and hoping for a matching card is a big part of the game. Gamble high unsuccessfully and the game can be lost early on.

With the played set, players can place one army to the board with each consecutive army in the same area being more expensive. The leader of the set played grants a special effect depending on his suit. Only six of the twelve suits are in each single game ensuring variance between plays. A good game for a higher player count if played reasonably quickly."

721,juuzzom,6,"Ethnos is quick playing and peaceful old school-ish Euro area majority game. It combines TtR-style card drafting during three rounds that you don't know of when they are going to end. It is a mix of known mechanisms combined with uninspired, generic fantasy art. Beginning of the game is very random and you can't plan much early on.

The only downside to the game is the theme. It's a pretty abstract game so the theme could be most anything. The audience is probably limited by it being orcs and wizards theme'

Thought this to be a solid midweight euro in which each game will potentially look different as different races/abilities are in play. This one is cleverly put together and plays quickly. My only frustration is how much you draw card unseen and fate unseen in this one and wish there was a visible tableau most of the game. When you do play a set, you do discard all cards you do not use in the set to the tableau. Ripe for expansions."

The variety of races act as card suits with inherent abilities and keep game plays fresh and interesting. My only complaint is the tendency for the draw action to deteriorate into a boring exercise in top-decking when the available card pool nears depletion waiting for cards to be added. Perhaps this could be resolved by allowing for a minimum pool size as in Ticket to Ride or allowing for two cards to be drawn off the top deck with one discarded to the pool.

A bit of set collecting and a bit of risk and reward strategy as you can try to take certain locations in order to get more victory points. You can spread yourself thinner and maybe get the points for 2nd or 3rd place in a region, but run the risk of low payoff. Or you can put your eggs in only a few baskets to get first or second place, but you risk not being the top influence in that region and losing all that you worked for and get no payoff.

So far, so good, want to play at the higher player counts as I truly believe that's where this game will shine.

You can play one card or many cards, but when you play all remaining cards are discarded.  You can only hold 10 cards.  Each race a different ability.  You are trying to gain control of different territories. And you score after the third dragon shows up in the course. 

The game was ok.  It was light and it had some decisions but often you find yourself drawing blind for a card, hoping for the card you need before the round ends.  It is too light and a bit of miss for me.  "

Solid if a little dry. My group tends to like player interaction, even if it is just trash talk. For some reason, we were quite silent while playing this game. We like that the turns are very quick. But it seems that the deliberation about what/how to play doesn't require players to speak to each other. Likely because this game is simply about setting up majorities without direct conflict. Still, a decent game and very easy to pick up. Would make a decent gateway game. As far as the art....old school fantasy roleplaying feeling. The game name....kinda lame....but at it's heart the game is pretty good. Time will tell if it's a keeper.
Further plays confirm that this game is really dry. Wanted to love it, but I really can't."

846,Madmallows,8.5,"This game is an absolute joy on the table. I really enjoy the set collections along with area control/placement mechanic. After a few plays, you learn how to improve your strategy. 

The large number of tribes in this game create a lot of replay value which I love very much. Additionally, I really like how some tribes come with other player boards and tokens. I thought this created unique ways to play. 

Only one thing I didn't like that well. The scoring at each age was a little confusing with multiple people. After reading how to do it multiple times in the rule book, I still think I got it wrong. That is on me to fully understand and communicate correctly.  

Lastly, I wanted to make a comment on the Trolls tribe. I love and hate this tribe. This tribe balances ties in the game. Every time I have played with Trolls, they have single handedly determined the outcome of the game. The tribe is absolutely great in the game and I do welcome it very much. More plays of the game will probably change my relationship with this tribe.

Overall, an absolutely great game. The art and theme could have been better but do not overlook this game. It's easy to play and isn't long. Highly recommend for any gamer group."

You're not just doing basic color set collection, but you're also trying to get abilities that will give you an advantage one way or another.  Super fast gameplay that can handle a lot of players.  Looks to be a keeper.

Originally picked up Royals as a light area majority game for my collection.  Similar to Ethnos since you're using set collections to claim ""Royals"".  However, Ethnos is way more exciting to play.  I know Ethnos gets picked on for it's art, but it also is much easier to parse visually than Royals - now that's an ugly game and makes it a bit harder to play than it should!  Royals will be leaving my collection and I don't see Ethnos budging.  Should get fairly regular play."

Very little downtime so turns go quickly.

Because random cards are selected at during setup as well as points for each section of the island different strategies are used each time you play keeping the game feeling fresh. 

The quick turn order and diversity in cards makes you want to immediately play again.

I like the artwork used on the cards. 


Bad: 
Card quality is very lackluster, they are extremely thin and feel flimsy. 

The art used for the board is very generic and drab. I would have preferred something more vibrant and varied.

The markers are oddly colored, I am not sure if this is so it's color blind friendly but the colors selected are pretty ugly.  

Even though there are a decent number of races in the core box I would have liked to see even more (that don't require extra boards) for additional variety.

The insert is also awful for holding the player tokens.  Fortunately, the tokens come in plastic bags and the box has extra space to hold them (as if they knew it was horrible to begin with).  Makes you wish they had gone for a much smaller box and cut out all that wasted space.

Production aside, this is the perfect gateway area control game that I will keep coming back to thanks to its surprisingly fast, deep, and varied card-play.

It's one of those ""oh, it's my turn again?"" superfast games, yet gives players a lot to think about. Marvellous tension between collecting cards and timing when you cash them in to place a marker, and even though there's no direct battling between players, the fight to snag cards gets fierce--you need to watch opponents like a hawk to notice which races and regions they are collecting and anticipate when they might cash in and leave you with a few discards to pick over."

-Theme
-Not ""crunchy"" enough

Plays very similar to Ticket to Ride, but a lot quicker. There is no tension though to place your markers as fast as possible (only when the age is almost over), which might be a plus to some and a minus to others.

How I felt about this game went about the same way as Love Letter; I wasn't really engaged until I found the strategy. I thought the game was mostly luck (or at least, my play style was just based on luck), until my 3rd-4th game, when I noticed a player had just big sets of cards, and only had markers in the most valuable territories. I changed my strategy from then on and I love it a lot more now! I love how clean and quick it plays. Unfortunately, the theme is just awful. Luckily, the theme of Ticket to Ride is also awful, but at least many people know that game already.

UPDATE: It is with much pain in my heart that I sold this game. I still liked it but it was on the edge really. The art was probably the final factor; I just can't use it as a gateway game with THAT art/theme."

Doesn't look thaaat fun, but I think the hand management, area control, and different races make it feel like you need some level of foresight in your next turn. The cards you get change your plans, and so it all feels pretty rewarding for such a light game."
984,newkillerstar27,7,"I like this game, but a few things keep me from being as enamored with it as I normally would be. For one thing, the theme is almost nonexistent. You're playing these fantasy races in sets to control areas of the board, but the theme could have almost been anything. Also, the little discs that you use to show control are one of my least favorite components ever. They're difficult to store properly in the insert, and they're so difficult to stack that they constantly fall apart when I handle them. Lastly, I feel like the round end scoring is a little awkward at times. In each area of the board, ties are very likely to happen, and so most of your points actually come from the sets you've made. It's fine, I guess, but a little strange in execution.

Those things aside, I did find myself enjoying Ethnos. It's a bit of a slog for an area control game that should be this simple, as you're only drawing one card every turn. It's also a little awkward that the card offer doesn't replenish unless someone has cards left in their hand after playing a set. It really made me long for the Ticket to Ride style of replenishing the offer and having the choice of drawing two cards every turn. Having to blindly draw one card from turn to turn can be really annoying.

I'm really coming off as nit-picky on Ethnos, but I don't really mean to. It was just a bit of a slow burn for me, and I imagine it will get better with repeated plays. This really does feel like the best gateway to area control out there, even if the fantasy theme may be a little off-putting for some. The area control actually isn't as interesting as the card play and their abilities, which range from really cool to just being extra ways of scoring points.

It all feels very dry and Euro-y, which is typical of Paulo Mori's games, but it is nonetheless fun. This is probably my favorite game of his along with Libertalia and Augustus, but all of them are prone to runaway leaders, which is a pretty major drawback for me. So time will tell if this game rises or falls for me, but I do think it has potential despite its rough edges."

You are either drafting  a card from the draw deck or face up on the table, or you are forming a band of cards of the same suit, which allow you to put  a control token on the map for area control scoring. The band of cards also score points for the length, with the longer the better. Your other unplayed cards go face up on the table after you band. 

The end of the round is triggered by the appearance of the third dragon card and the game last 3 rounds. 

It's a fun game, as there is tension when the second dragon card shows up, and you want to complete a band before the third dragon card ends the round. The mechanics are easy. Yes, there is luck in your initial card, and what you draw afterwards. It's fun to explore the different abilities of the tribes.

It's a real shame as it feels like in the hands of a Days or Wonder or a Space Cowboys that this could have been a modern classic with lasting broader appeal along the lines of a Ticket to Ride or Splendor.

I find that certain factions (Merfolk, for example) can only run their course for so long before they start providing diminishing returns.  The components and artwork are beautiful, and the theme is unique in that anyone playing can ignore it and focus on the mechanics, and yet anyone can easily step back and see how the theme makes sense to what you are doing in the game.

1021,oninoyakamo,7,"I find that when I encounter a game that I can describe as ""It's like ______, but with ______"" I usually wind up preferring the original to the remix, unless there is some aspect of the original that has been significantly improved. Ethnos is a rare case where I can't decide which is better, it or the similar, Ticket To Ride.

So yes, Ethnos is just TTR, but with Area Control instead of Route Building. The thing that stands out in Ethnos is, when you play a set you are forced to discard all the other cards you have to the table, where they are available for other players to snatch up. Combined with each suit having its own powers, this makes for more strategic play than TTR without significantly increasing play time.

For those who find TTR too simplistic, Ethnos might be something to try.

P.S. Ethnos looks like it was trying to get a Tolkein license and failed. The art, graphic design of the board, even the font looks cribbed from War Of The Ring."

Pretty different playing times with 3 and 4+ players. As with 4+ you play 3 eras and I don't think game actually really is getting better with it, I'd prefer Ethnos as 3 player game more than with 4+ (6 already being too many for sure, maybe 5 too).

My enjoyment might depend a bit on race combinations though, I don't mind phases of random card draws for a bit, but having elves and centaurs together in our most recent game gave us way too much of that due to the display never really filling up again, so I might try to stay away from that combination. Otherwise I do like the variety of different combinations though and the feel of the game does indeed change based on what is in play, while still maintaining its overall ease of play.

1035,Panzerknacker,6,"The typical average game that you join, but don't suggest. A bit of set collection with area majority. The tokens look a bit extraordinary (these are penny-sized plastic saucers that you stack on top of each other), the graphics are, yes ... ""nice"". The map and those fantasy beings immediately evoke associations with Small World, but that's misleading, because mechanically, both games have hardly little in common. Draw a card, or better to take a face up one out of the row? Do I play my set, or do I speculate on getting a better one? It all reminds me more of Ticket to Ride. Or rather Lost Cities? Okay, there is this little twist: If a player plays a set, the leftover cards are put back into the row of open cards. Well. Yeah. Nevertheless, Ethnos is not really worth of too many words."

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (2):[/COLOR]

[i]I'll just cut to the chase, I haven't disliked a game this much in a long time. I was really looking forward to playing Ethnos; I love area control and the idea of combining it with a set collection mechanic sounded fun. It wasn't... at all. The game is almost completely driven by luck. Each age, of which there are 3, ""x"" number of cards laid out depending on player count. That row never refills until a player plays a set and then has to discard their remaining cards to the display, this leads to countless turns of drawing blindly from the top of the deck. Because of this, it becomes difficult trying to plan at all; as the game goes on you can't count on getting a card you can use. 

For me Ethnos fails as an area control game; the best part of an area control game is the constant jockeying for position with other players by moving your pieces around. Not only can't you do that in Ethnos, due to the random card draw it was almost impossible to plan when you'd be able to add another token to a specific region.

Ethnos is a frustrating game to play and wastes unbelievable potential. The different race abilities are interesting, although some are clearly better than others; the lack of control takes away from your ability to execute any king of strategy. I will not be playing Ethnos again and I'd caution anyone who gets caught up in the hype of certain reviewers. Marco Arnaudo summarizes the problems with this game in his [geekurl=/video/128034/ethnos/video-review]review[/geekurl]. If you are looking for a family weight, area control game that also uses set collection I would highly recommend [thing=165986]Royals[/thing].[/i]"

1041,patela2,7,"Played once at 3 players. I found it to be a decent ""gamers"" alternative to Ticket to Ride, more complex and (to me) more interesting. Set up and rules explanation is a bit time-consuming due to the different races available, but after a few turns things were fine. I think it would be better at 4 or 5 player count, with more competition going on. I followed another users recommended setup, which I think works well: Merfolk, Orcs, Trolls, Centaurs, Minotaurs and Wingfolk."

- The race powers add some spice

What I don't like:
- Majority scoring
- No points for second place in an area

1051,Pedrator,7,Fun game but needs more play. But very fast paced and enjoyable.
1052,pekin2121,8,"A fairly simple area control/set collecting game. I like there are 3 ages to play through (Two with 2 or 3 players), scoring happens at the end of each age and your control markers stay on the board. There is a decent amount variety as you randomly select the armies that will be used each game (by flipping over 6 army selection cards) and each army has a special ability, 4 or 5 of them have small extra boards for even more scoring. One of the mechanics is one you place a band of allies (matching set of cards) you must discard the rest of your hand face-up on the table for other players to draw from, unless your leader of the band has a special ability to prevent that (Elves let you keep X number of cards and Centaurs let you place a second band of allies)."
1053,pemby96,7.5,"Simple and easy to teach, Ethnos is becoming my favorite game to teach to people who don't normally play games. Area control, set collection, and even hand management make this game fun for people who play a lot of games as well."

I could play this game about 5 times in a row and not get bored of it. The turns are lightning fast which I think is one of it's most endearing qualities. You will not be bored because it will be back around to your turn again before you know it. There is a lot more game here than you would think as well. A massive amount of possible race combinations makes for an endlessly entertaining and engaging game. One of my current favorites.

I'd rate it slightly higher if it had a non-generic theme, artwork that is easy to differentiate and wooden chips instead of those neon plastic things.

German review: https://peterrustemeyer.wordpress.com/2017/11/13/angespielt-ethnos/"
1058,peteyandycreek,6,"2 plays - This game did seem over-hyped. It didn't help that the first time I played, I was presented with very few good options for almost the entirety of the game. The 2nd time I had a better run, but watched others suffer the same fate. There is a lot more luck in the card draws than I had first anticipated.

With that aside, the different faction abilities were all very unique and interesting, ranging from additional card draws (wizard), becoming the leader of the giants or progressing yourself on a track (merfolk thingys). I really enjoyed using the abilities and deciding which character powers to 'lead' a card set. The area control aspect is also a very well-conceived idea. As an area becomes more populated with control markers, it simultaneously takes you bigger (and therefore more challenging) card sets to advance. This coupled with the varying point tokens makes for a very well engineered and balanced area control game, where high point tokens are more greatly contested. 

The artwork is obviously lacking but really, don't get to caught up on that. Many German style euro games are equally as boring, if not more drab, but are still widely loved. I think this point is definitely over-made and for a game that's simple and quick, you'll not even notice it once you get past setup.

Overall, I feel this game could have become one of the 'very greats', but unfortunately is tarred by its over-reliance on luck, which ultimately takes a lot of 'player agency' away. As it is, I'd still have fun playing this from time to time with a crowd who were just looking for some laughs and not something too strategic."

1060,pezpimp,7,"Based on one play: A nice light game which can be played at up to six and seems to play best with more players. You select a number of tribes equal to the number of players and then turn by turn you select cards from an open draw pile or blind from the deck. You goal is to make sets and play them in order to take control of areas on the board or to get points from special powers. When you play cards you have to discard all the remaining cards in your hand and also get a bonus for larger sets. It was quite fun and easy to teach to others, a good game for even casual gamers that still has some strategy. Interested to play again and see the other tribes."
1061,pfctsqr,8,"Rummy with teeth. Ethnos has just the right number of scoring avenues and the different factions guarantee a ton of variety and replay value.

1065,Phrim,7,"Ethnos is a set-collection area-majority game set in a fantasy universe. Each game will use six of the 12 possible races; cards from those races are shuffled into a large deck. Players must then collect and play cards either all of the same race or all of the same color to place a token in a region--the number of cards in the set must exceed the number of tokens you already have in that region. The card on top of the played set determines the color of the region you place in, and its race determines the special ability you get when you play the set. At the end of each of the three rounds, players score majorities for regions, as well as triangular points for the size of their sets. This game was very easy to learn and play. However, as a card game it had a significant random factor, and lacked some of the strategic depth I would like.

I call it Smallworld meets Ticket to Ride meets Exploding Kittens.  Basically I'm drawing cards, getting a bunch that are similar and then playing them down to do something cool for points.  It can be taught in 5 minutes, played in 30-45, and I've almost never taught it to someone without them immediately saying, ""let's play that again."""

The overly battle-y front cover and bland board are really the only downsides to this game which, at its heart, is one of area control by way of set collection. The geography of the board is not used at all (in the base game, I'm hoping an expansion will give it some purpose) but everything gels together very nicely indeed. The game can absolutely fly - even at six players - when everyone is drawing cards, so allowing time for the band-making decision is then fair enough. The different races allow for good variability, although if teaching to new players, I'd suggest using the 'obvious' powers (Wizard, Dwarf, Halfling, Giant for starters) before kicking in with the funkier ones.

Ticket to Ride area control (med-light weight set collection), variable set up with what race cards (w/corresponding special powers) are included in each game. Production and theme a bit dull, but not unappealing. Probably won't get this one, since we'd play almost exclusively with 2 players and that experience seems a bit lacking (but I would probably prefer to play this over TtR).

1104,quietcorn,6,"This is an area majorities flip luck heavy game that genuinely manages to be compelling, which is an unusual thing for me to encounter. The idea is this; the central board has different regions that do a majority scoring each round. On your turn you draw one card from either the faceup display or the top of the facedown deck, or you play one or more cards that either all have the same color, or have the same fantasy race, and then you discard the rest of your unplayed hand to the display for other players to pick over. If the cards you played were greater than the number of tokens you have in the region of matching color, you get to add one new token. You also get to use the special power of the top card in the set played, and this is where the game gets really interesting. Despite how luck of the draw it is, you actually wind up with interesting puzzles in your hand as you have to choose what you want to go for, faction ability, color, and which province you are aiming for. Then you also have an aspect of pushing your luck, knowing that each time you blind draw to improve your set, you're running the risk of improving other player's draws. 

The rounds can end suddenly, as three dragon cards get seeded in the bottom half of the deck. This can often create some frustration as players might have been lining up a great move right before the round suddenly ends, and they're forced to discard their hands. It's an interesting tension, that I perhaps would like a lot less in a longer game, but in this format it seems fine.

The faction powers are all really interesting, and they interact with each other in compelling ways depending on the setup, as you don't see every power every game. Another compelling aspect of this game is that there's also the option to ignore the board state, and focus on getting larger sets of cards, which can score big points at the end of the round.

I don't see this game becoming a favorite, but it's a really nice light ride.

1106,qwertymartin,7,"Friends will be shocked to hear that I enjoyed a game with orcs in it! But beneath the lazy pasted-on fantasy setting is a stripped-down old-school Euro with a dash of modern variable setup and special powers.

There are a number of similarities to Ticket to Ride: each turn is a simple choice to draw a card from a display or play a matching set of cards; playing a set allows you to play markers on the board which may score later, but you also score directly for the size of sets you play. But instead of route-building, the board-play is pure area majority, and to add a counter to a region, the set of cards you play must be larger than the number of counters you already have there.

So far so simple, and the turns move pleasantly briskly (in fact the biggest problem was players not realising it was their turn again already!). But there are a couple of twists. At the beginning of the game, 6 races (this is where the bloody orcs come in) are randomly chosen from 12. When you play a set of cards, you also choose one of them to be the leader and get to execute the special power of the associated race. Some give extra scoring opportunities; some get round the restrictions on adding counters to the board; and some help you mitigate the other big twist...

Unlike Ticket to Ride, there's a hand limit and when you play a set, you have to discard the rest of your hand into the face-up display for the other players to pick over - in fact, this is the only way the display gets replenished. This helps with the briskness because you can only really focus on one objective at a time, but it also generates the biggest complaint about the game. Often the display will be empty and the players are reduced to drawing blind, hoping to add to a set. 

Opinions on the game in our group were divided and I suspect this was correlated to the amount of luck in drawing the right cards from the deck. Time will tell if it was due only to my good fortune, but it was a good first impression for me."

1111,rajungamer,8,"A set collection/area control game, with a fantasy theme. On your turn you draft a card into your hand, or play a band from your hand. A band must be either the same color with different races or different colors of the same race. One card is chosen as a leader which determines the location of the board to place a control marker, a twist is that the band must be larger than the number of control tokens already on the board for the player. Also the the race gives you a special ability, to twist the rules. The remaining cards must be discarded to the table and are now available for draft.

The size of the bands determine the number of points scored. Being in lead for the regions determines control for scoring the regions. Some of the races have some specialized scoring for that race.

Easy to learn, fast paced, mechanics are clean and understandable. Some variety is provide that only 6 of the 12 races are used during the game. All in all a nice little game."

The map seems completely superfluous; could just as easily have been 6 colored cards or 6 tracks. Hoping they add expansions in the future which take adjacency of regions into account."

Some factions like Orcs or Merfolk offer interesting decisions around hand management and side objective timing, but for the most part there's not much strategy involved here.
Also worth mentioning is that Ethos completely breaks down into a game of pure luck of the draw at 5 & 6 players."

Perhaps it's because understanding the powers of the races (which vary from game to game) is integral to success. Such knowledge only comes with repeated play, and that seems counter to what a gateway game should be.

1142,richcharters,9.105,"I'm generally not a huge fan of area control because it can be too contentious.  However, the game mechanics make this a keeper for me.  On your turn, you either draw a card (blindly from the deck, or from one of the face up cards) or you play a set to the table.  However, when you play a set, you have to place face-up all the unused cards from your hand (you can't keep cards in your hand when you make a set)....so you set up the next player for a good turn.

Each card has a color (corresponds to a certain area on the board) and a race (corresponds to a power when you play the set).

You go through the deck 3 times....each round the area control bonuses are larger than the previous rounds.  You don't know exactly when each round will end....it's tiggered by a card draw (3rd dragon card).

(+) Novel mix of area majority, set collection, and push-your-luck elements is fresh. Multiple races contribute to the variety found in each play.
(+) Simple, straightforward ruleset.
(+) Able to accommodate high player counts without losing a beat in the pace of the gameplay.

(-) Far too luck driven--turns almost always devolve into players fishing for a card that can salvage their hand from the deck.
(-) Decisions are not very meaningful. Often, the action you take on your turn is quite obvious.
(-) For an area majority game, it lacks tension through conflict. This is unsual, to say the least."

1174,rseater,6,"Trolls are terrible for the game.  Tie breaks are just too good, and getting the most troll tokens is just too random.

My first game also included (at random) several cards that have weak powers and thus further add luck to the draw (hobbits, giants).  Looking at the omitted cards, I think the game would be better on a repeat with a different mix.  Many of the other sets reward larger hands, add tactical tradeoffs, and reduce variance overall.

But separate from that, the game can get a bit slow -- individual turns are generally fast, but you get so little done each turn that the overhead of passing the turn adds up.  Also, one slow player (Even if they are justifiable managing a large hand with a lot of centaurs or elves) slows down every one of those micro-plays.  If everyone keeps up the pace, it's not too bad but still can suffer."

1186,Ryucoo,6,"A neat idea which combines a sort of traditional card game like Rummy with area control but ultimately let down by the fact the set collecting completely dominates the scoring system to the point the board almost feels redundant. The clan powers have some nice touches but ultimately many make the game swing so violently towards the cards that you simply have to play without them for the area control aspect to have any value. 

Many seem to complain about the resulting blind draw when the market inevitably runs dry but miss that the game is really found in keeping the market as bare as possible. Which I suppose is the problem - as a player trying to win, you want to keep the market empty; as a player trying to have fun, you want a full market to give you actual choices. A good game shouldn't have fun and betterment pulling in different directions; games should be more fun the harder you play. 

There's a game in here somewhere; a second edition with improved art/components, an overhaul of the set vs area control balance, and more choices on the player turn that soften the frustration at merely drawing the top card of a deck over and over - and I might be interested in taking a second look. As it is, the sum is just a lot less than its parts."

We played with a wrong rule where we thought we could put our chip anywhere as opposed to the region represented by the leader's card, but I still enjoyed it even then, so I can imagine I'd like it even more with the added thinkiness that provides. Has a very uncommon mechanic where once you place a set you have to put all the other cards into the middle of the table for others to get, so collecting a bunch of cards could end up being a waste of precious turns and a lot more agonizing. Also like how it plays up to six players with no scaling issues that I could tell.

Wish the game had a more unique theme instead of dreary-looking generic fantasy, though. I'd probably get this to the table all the time if it had a more interesting and family friendly theme. Box art doesn't help the game look interesting either."

-It plays up to six players.
-It is easy to teach, yet still offers at least a bit of thinking to not absolutely bore actual gamers.
-12 races (out of which you only use a random 6 per game) offer quite some variety

Cons:

-Absolutely no flair or the like, random theme. This might as well be a 100% abstract game.
-Even for a gateway game, a bit shallow. Just a few more options would have improved it significantly I think."
1208,schnapes,7,"It's okay, I think a lot of people will like this but doesn't set the world alight, set collection with area control and push your luck all nicely combined, only minor gripe is that perhaps the strategy might be a bit solvable and then it's all a matter of hitting the right cards."
1209,Scholle,7,"This moves at a very quick pace, but part of that is down to the lack of choices you have. If you have no cards you need to pick one up. If you need two or three cards to add to an area then you need to pick up another card. Along the way are decisions like whether you want to jump into an area cheaply or hopefully keep drawing that race or colour to hopefully add to an area you're already in. At the end of the day the choices are rather limited and the game is almost playing you. Almost. With a simple take a card from the top of the deck mechanism you draw what you draw and there's not much you can do about it. What separates the scores however should for the most part come down to the little decisions and the little risks you take. Some of that comes down to card counting. Some of it comes down to evaluating whether the reward is worth it. They're the decisions.

I think this one is rather decent for two main reasons: Firstly it's quick. The turns are quick and the game is quick. Little things might cost you a bunch of points, but it's all good because you haven't invested a whole evening into the game. You take your lumps and enjoy the ride. Secondly there are twelve different races to choose five or six from each game. That spices up games and gives you something to explore. (It needs it, because otherwise it'd get old quickly.) The points available in the areas will change from game to game, but playing, for instance, with or without Wizards is going to make for a different experience. Each race has it's own little or big quirk that mixes up the rules in a small and yet not insignificant way. Nice.

The game plays great with six players and is easy to teach. Worthwhile for any collection if you need something light and an hour long that plays with five or six. The fantasy theme is the usual fluff, but it needs a theme, so it might as well be goblins, trolls, orcs, giants..."

On it's face, it's a Ticket to Ride Style game. Draw a card or play some cards. There's a push your luck element that can leave you holding some points, but it's never so disruptive as to ruin your round. You have to keep watch on the points you're scoring yourself and the ones you're competing for with your opponents. Turns move really fast too, so downtime is basically nonexistant. 

Add to this the replayability introduced by the random faction setup. The combinations of factions, each with their own special effect, can drastically alter strategies from one game to the next.

I'm probably rating it more harshly than I should as it wasn't long and wasn't terrible, but man...where is the game.  It's area control, which I normally detest, but it doesn't feel like you're in control of anything.  You're top-decking cards most of the game, which makes for a total random mess in your hand.  One of our players was literally just collecting every card he didn't need.  The production quality is also dicey.  The map is ok, but it might as well be 6 islands since adjacency means nothing.  The control markers are terrible.  The insert is trying to be this perfect means to hold everything and it fails.  The primary good thing is that the pain ends relatively quickly."

Players form melds of factions in their hands to lay down influence on the board, and each faction comes with a special ability too. These special abilities could boost your chances at area majorities, meld scoring or even set up a subgame for VP.

The key to enjoying Ethnos is to accept that you will be drawing mystery meat from the deck for most of the game. Yes, you are reliant on luck of the draw, but that doesn't mean that the decisions you make don't matter either. There still is tension in deciding which meld you'd want to gun for and which scoring avenue to prioritise. If there is one thing I dislike about Ethnos, it's that the grim artwork is a mismatch. It sets up expectations for a brooding, conflict-ridden game when the reality is that the game is much closer to say, Ticket to Ride in nature.

Yes it shares many similarities with other area control/set collection games, yet there's a lot of variability here so it never feels ""samey"" to me. The simple mechanic of discarding unused cards when laying down sets is brilliant & makes for some difficult decision making. I haven't played it with more than 4 players so I'm not sure how well it scales beyond that, but if you can look past the unassuming box crack this one open because I think you'll like it."

Nagyon egyedi játék. A játékos a körében vagy húz a játékosszámtól függően x darab fajból álló piacról vagy pakliból egy lapot vagy kijátszik a kezéből ugyanolyan színű vagy ugyanolyan fajú kártyákat. A kijátszott kártyák legfölső lapja adja meg azt a színt, amelyik területre a térképen elhelyezheti egy saját jelölőjét. A kártyák darabszáma azt határozza meg, hogy hanyadik saját jelölőjét rakhatja le. Egy területre az első jelölő 1 kártya, a második 2 és így tovább. A kör végén a területi többséget és a lerakott kártyacsomagok számát értékeljük. A fajok különböző tulajdonsággal rendelkeznek, amik segítik a játékost. A játékban rengeteg helyen fellép a szerencse. Csak egy lap húzásakor a pakliból (legtöbbször onnan húzunk, mert a piac gyorsan ürül), a körök vége feltétele a pakliba véletlenszerűen bekevert sárkányok harmadikjának kihúzása, az ellenfelek királycsinálása, de a játék nem hosszú és emiatt számomra elviselhető a szerencse. Minden játékosszámmal szerintem jó lehet, akár 6-an is játszható. Nagy az újrajátszhatósági faktora, mert nem minden faj játszik egyszerre, a területek pontjai is játékról játékra változnak. Szinte nincs holtidő, mert nagyon gyors egy játékos köre. Rengeteg jó tulajdonság. Jó élmény volt az első parti."
1263,Sin4profit,7.5,"Liked this game a great deal. The setup makes for an exciting ending as you reveal two dragon heads and have to determine if you're going to press your luck with a long play or squeeze in a few easy points.

One of my main problems with the game is it's scoring. It presents you with many ways to score points but from my experience, larger set collections are the way to win. I just wish the other ways to score were better balanced or the game featured some bonus end game scoring that can make for some exciting come backs."

I think Ticket to Ride actually has more strategic (long term) planning due to the permanence of resources and being forced to make long term plans to do well. So Ticket to Ride is the more skillful game, though I'm not sure which is more random (TTR destination ticket draws are very random)

1277,Slaverzguild,8,"Similar to ""Ticket to Ride"" in both mechanisms and weight and quite possibly a better game. Instead of playing the board as ""Ticket to Ride"" does, where the board determines the routes and cards needed to claim them, ""Ethnos"" has you playing yourself. To lay claim to a territory you need to accumulate more cards than the influence you already have in that territory. 

In a great twist, all cards in a players hand not played as a band are added to the pool for other players to take!

1284,snoozefest,7.5,"2 plays

What a cool, quick, streamlined area-majorities / card drafting / set collection kinda game! The rules are quite simple but game play is still interesting. The powers vary widely (meld another set before discarding, hold onto some cards, place in any region, count as a bigger set, etc.) and with so many races in the box (and surely more coming soon?), you'll play a different combination every time!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players start with a hand of cards, each of which belongs to one of the races and has one of 6 colors (corresponding to the 6 regions of the board). There's also a random display of 5(?) cards at the start. On your turn, you either draw a card or play card(s).
- Draw = take a card from Display or deck, add it to your hand. If you draw a Dragon (3 were shuffled into bottom half of deck), discard it and replace unless it was the 3rd Dragon = end of Era (immediately)
- Play = meld a set of cards, either all the same color or all the same race, with one card on top. The top card's power activates. Then, if the size of the set exceeds the number of your tokens in the top card's board region (matching color), you may place another token there. Then, add the rest of your hand to the Display!

When the Era ends, score each region (chits worth 0-10 VP were randomly distributed during setup; values increase with each Era) according to area majority: award VP for 1st place in Era 1, 1st/2nd in Era 2, 1st/2nd/3rd in Era 3. Also earn VP for your sets of 2+ cards. Then shuffle all the cards and repeat. After 3 Eras, most VP wins!"

1287,soccastar001,8,"This is a great set collection and area control game that actually feels like it has some similarities to Colossal Arena.

When starting the game you select a sub-set of the fantasy races included in the game and shuffle them up into a deck.  Players on their turn will play sets of these cards either of the same color (each fantasy set also comes in several different colors) or same fantasy race.  Playing these sets allows you to use the special ability of that race but also put area control tokens on the map.  Depending on the races used there are various different ways to score points besides the standard area control.

The components right down to the plastic box insert are pretty well done as well."
1288,SocksRule,6.5,"Interesting combination of area control and set collection.  Unfortunately, it is a game that wouldn't request to play.

Card counting, chain effects, keeping track of the number of cards in players hands, remembering what cards players add to their hand, etc. 

It’s also fast. It can be played in 60 minutes if everyone is on point, but 90 is more the expected play time with jovial banter and players pretending they drew the last dragon. 

This is not an incredible game, but it fills its niche exceptionally well. It has replaced Mission: Red Planet as my go to 5 - 6 player game."
1313,srand,6.5,"Clever area majority game where players place tokens by playing a set of cards of the same fantasy race or the same colour (in which case they count as the race of the top card). Regions are colour coded and you can only play there if the top card matches; each of the races has a special power, like ""play anywhere"" or ""counts as plus one strength"".

I like this a lot, though the production is ugly and compares very unfavourably to the similar-concept Small World. My real issue is the card draw mechanism, which seems to end up with players just drawing random cards off the top of the deck a lot. (When a player puts out a set, all excess cards are made available and public, but the tempo doesn't seem to work quite right.)

A very good game that should have been a great game."

1335,sucrates,7.5,"Good, quick playing game with a lot of depth and replayability.A set-collection game with an area control component. The map suggest a heavier empasis on the area control as it basically has, as point scoring is a little tilted towards the sets. But both areas require a decent presence to actually grab a win. Add in bonus conditions as a side-track giving extra free board presence plus a minor account of VPs, and a side board giving an extra set to complete over the course of the game and the result is a game with a lot of choices.The variable setup adds replayability, as only a subset of card powers will be present each game. Deciding what set to collect, when to cash in on any given set in hand (forcing you to discard any excess towards a publicly available pool for your adversaries), and deciding which card will be using its ability means a lot of meaningful choices without getting swamped in them. The variable end of each round means you can get hosed if it comes quicker as expected (meaning the round order is deciding whether you cab cash in your last set), but that also results in a spike in tension keeping the tension arc fluctuating.The game has some drawbacks as well. First, the theme is clearly a paste-on. The map is a copy of Slovakia (why?). The gamebox is a thematic mismatch: it promises war and mayhem, where the 'conflict' is more along the lines of El Grande. But the biggest drawback is the big luck of the draw. If you draw a perfect set, you're golden. If you draw all different, basically you are both wasting turns as setting your adversaries up for even bigger sets. Keeping what you have is only a very limited option, as you don't have much knowledge about the hands of your adversaries. This is a big thing, as Ethnos is a strategic game at hearth, and in those games a big luck factor has too much impact on your plans.That being said, this is an excellent game: enjoyable, engaging, very playable and not too lengthy, with meaningful choices along the way. As someone that generally dislikes set-collection games, this game is highly recommended, especially for those that like this mechanic!"

Yes, you get points for area majorities, but your decisions are so constrained by the cards, it's impossible to position yourself with any strategic purpose like you would in a game like El Grande.

The different decks that come into play can change the focus of the game from set collection to board play from game to game depending on the races in play.

But for a game that presents itself out as an area majority game, it's surprisingly high on the MPS scale. A few races put you in competition (and one allows you to steal other people's bands), but mostly you're just drawing cards and placing them down and picking them up Rummy style.

1357,taloskhaos,5.9,"I really don't get this game, it isn't a horrible game, infact it has some great design and ideas, and yet for as many items as there are to praise in this game, there are an equal number that leave me scratching my head:

1) This game is simply too long for what it is, even if you keep turns moving, it easily would last for 2-3 hours on a good day (assuming you had 4+ players)  This might be ok for real thinky games, but this game is as light as Azul.

2) While the game has some depth, it doesn't have that much depth, and in a world of Azuls, Spice Roads, and Splendor which are tight designs with breadths of depth it really makes me wonder, why?

3) What makes #1 more problematic, is that turns are too simplistic.  The turn decisions and the amount you can do is, at times, even simpler than some of the simplest games I have ever played.  Seriously, there are turns where all you can do is draw a single card from a deck.  This may be forgiveable in a 15 minute ultra-short party game, but this game is many hours long, and if you play with social players who add 30 seconds to each turn in social talk while they draw a card, the game could seriously drag to 3,4, or even 5 hours.  It is so confusing to me.

4) What is with this theme? I was convinced this game came out in the 90s.  This is generic fantasy, clearly modeled after Lord of The Rings and they even hired the same artist (John Howe) who did illustrations for the films and LOTR.  It just kind of flabbergasts me, John Howe is a great artist but can we have a game where he isn't drawing dwarves and elves please?

Now, I tend to start my reviews negatively, people who are going to buy a game should hear the critical side, and as you can see, I have a lot of critical things to say about this game.  But, if I were to go to someone's house and they had this game setup on a table, I wouldn't refuse to play it.  It has some great ideas and I love that the dudes-on-the-map are controlled by set collection.  I just can't recommend the game, and if I saw it on a table, I would make sure everyone there knew what they were in for: an overly long game with overly simplistic turns.  If they were ok with this, I suppose I could be to.

1365,Teamjimby,6.5,"Ethnos is a mix between [thing=9209][/thing] and Rummy.  You collect cards and play sets (bands) of matching colors or races to play in front of you.  By playing a set, you score points based on the set size and get to place a piece on one of the six regions.  At the end of each round, points are awarded for majority of the regions.  So, this all feels similar to TTR in that you are collecting sets, scoring points for big sets, and placing pieces on the board competing for limited real estate against your opponents.

There are two good things going for the game.  First is that when you play a set of cards, you have to discard your remaining cards to the market.  So, unlike TTR, you don't accumulate like 30 cards in hand before you start playing sets.  It also makes it painful to keep drawing cards trying to find that last one you want.  Secondly, each race has a unique power and the available races is randomized each game.  This gives a little more decision space to work with.

Ultimately, it felt like I was playing a slightly-more-gamer-y version of TTR.  I'm not sure I really need another family-style lightweight game like this, but it's certainly inoffensive and could be a good filler plus at the beginning or end of the night."

1377,the night stalker,7.5,"based upon one play, found this game very impressive - enjoy the variable powers which seem like they would make this game very replayable"
1378,The Nue,9.5,"Typically I like my games as complicated as you can make them, but there are always exceptions. Ethos is so straightforward you could almost categorize it as a Rule Breaking mechanic game... Basically you have a short and simple set of rules about determining area controls across a three round game. The excitement comes in with the fact you have 12 races (sets of card faces) of which you will randomly take 6, and each race has a single effect and each set of cards (band) you put down will borrow the effects of its top and area targeting card (leader). This takes a game otherwise all about band size and control degrees and complicates it by adding ""cheat"" effects bypassing normal rules, granting or advancing features of your plays, or providing new sources of victory points to compete over. Strategy is absolutely key, but there is no simple,pattern of ""winning strategy"" anyone can doggedly abuse... The relation between elements is simple, their constant flux is not. Playing well relies on being adaptive... Reacting to what other players do, choosing your battles to avoid conflicts more brutal than they're worth or to sweep in and edge out a foe, strike while the iron is hot when opportunities arise, prioritize pressing luck for a drastic play or counting on small victories to add up, and most of all, while RNG doesn't actively ruin or overly bless a player normally, making the best of the cards dumped into the communal drafting area and randomly dealt from the deck (and knowing when to do which!) all favor a player willing to roll with lunches and alter their strategy from one turn to another... Talents that rarely will one player in a circle have a monopoly on.

Aside from a varied play experience that rewards smart plays but should rarely preclude or guarentee any player in victory; the greatest virtue of Ethnos is how fast it is. Simple to learn and tach, minimal setup and tear down, turns are lightning fast (pull a card and pass turn more often than not), which makes for a game that can fit a match into small time window and wont clash with players who struggle waiting for their turn in games where turns are long, or who struggle with long games. Meanwhile, the box, board, cards, and pieces are all really nicely done, smooth, attractive, good art. The box interior was another thing I really appreciated... It's designed with shaped grooves for every one of the fair amount of extraneous pieces... Each has a place and it's obvious where it is, and they all slide in securely and space efficiently. It's gloriously well organized, honestly.... I normally use baggies to sort and consolidate games into smaller and more orderly parcels than the box... Ethnic is one of few exception where it's exemption isn't based on the box being to packed... Instead, it's just so wel organize and aesthetic as is, it feels foolish to repackage.

Honestly, I feel like I can hardly reccomend this game enough. It may lack the sharp complexity of games like Scythe or Valeria Card Kingdoms, but it's just so good at what it does, I adore it.... More similar to Hero Realms in its virtue: brilliant out of the box, gets you down to enjoying it quickly, basic variety keeps it fresh, victory is fair but not rigid, and like the comparison, easy on the wallet... Copies are going for 40 retail and you may manage to shave off ten bucks or so if you use discount sources. It's a great approachable game for everyone... The elves and wizards and skeletons may turn off the really stiff relatives who won't touch anything nerdier than Catan, but it's honestly so simple and straightforward I'd think no dedicated board game player would be turned off."
1379,theaaron,8,"First play impression: This is pure fun.

The game plays almost identically to Royals (slowly draw cards, then play sets of cards to place markers in various areas on the map). However, I felt like Royals was lacking something to push it beyond mediocre, and I think Ethnos adds the perfect element.

Ethnos adds a mechanic similar to Guildhall where each suit of cards has a unique ability and the ability is often stronger if you play more of those cards. This addition takes the barebones experience of Royals and adds combos, strategy, and more to think about. Also, you play with a different combination of cards each time so the experience will be quite a bit different from game to game.

I will say that there may be a fair amount of luck, which was also prevalent in Royals. You often end up drawing blindly from the deck and if you happen to get cards that match then you'll be in a better position. Sometimes you draw several times and none of the cards match color or type. I imagine the luck should even out over the course of the game, though.

Overall lots of fun. The ability to play from 3-6 players is nice and I imagine the game would work equally well with 4-6 (with three players you have to play a variant).

Update: After more plays the game is still great. I've seen people consider this a new gateway game and I can definitely see that. There's still a decent amount of luck of the draw but so far not enough to hinder the experience.

I also need to mention the player count. The game plays surprisingly well with three players, despite area control usually needing more players. More importantly, though, I've seen a number of reviewers talk about how perfectly this game scales at [b]all[/b] player counts and that is just wrong.

The two player game is bad. Sure, we all know that area control games don't work with two players, but it just needs to be restated here. I played a two player game just to show a friend how the game works and we aborted the game after the first age because it was so bad and there was nothing fun or interesting about the experience. The game already has a lot of luck, but with two players it comes down to pure luck. If you draw the right cards to take over the valuable areas and carry out some combos, you will win. With more players you have people discarding cards to the face-up draw row at different intervals, so timing is crucial as you try to wait out your opponents to see if they discard a card you've been waiting on. With two players you draw and discard at about the same pace so it just doesn't work.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-6[/b]"

Okay, the graphic design is a bit old fashioned, but the illustrations itself are fantastic. No wonder, considering John Howe is the Artist. John Howe is a fantasy artist, known for his conceptual work on Peter Jacksons middl-earth films (or the Lord of the Rings boardgame by Rainer Knizia). Sure, his art is a bit generic, but only because he is one of the originators of modern fantasy art. Is it his fault that he is so often copied by other artists?"
1402,Thrylos,7,Very nice area control game. It has a little bit of Ticket to Ride and Small World in it. It plays well even with 6 people. Not many area control games can do this well.
1403,Thunkd,7,"Ethnos is an area control game that's card based.  There are six regions.  At the beginning of the game the value of each region for each of the rounds is randomly determines by assigning VP tiles to each region.  The deck of cards has six colors (matching the regions) and six races (each with a special power).

On your turn you draw a card or play a ""band"".  A band is either a set of cards all of a color, or all of a race.  The purpose of playing a band is to put a disc in the region of the color that is the top card in your band (the leader).  Your band must have cards in excess of the number of discs you currently have in that region.  Additionally you do the special power of the band's leader's race.  When you play a band, any cards that aren't played to the band are put face up into a common area from which players may draw cards.  You can choose any cards in the common tableau or from the face down deck.  There are dragons randomly seeded in the bottom of the deck and when you find them all the round ends immediately.  

At the end of a round, all the regions are scored.  In the first round, only the first VP chit in each region is scored.  The player with the most discs in an area gets those points. Discs stay in regions from round to round.  In the second round the first and second place chits are scored and given respectively to the players with the most and second most discs.  And all three score in the third round, going to 1st, 2nd and 3rd most discs.

Additionally, you get points for the length of your bands that you've played.  A single card is worth zero points but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 cards are worth 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 points.  

The races change up the rules of how things work in interesting ways.  there's a good bit to think about.  There's some randomness with cards, which is okay.  Other players may inadvertently mess you up.   But overall I liked this game a lot."
1404,Thuustick,8,"Really enjoying this game at the moment. I liken it to Ticket to Ride plus. The component quality and theme are lacking, but the gameplay more than makes up for this."
1405,tiagoVIP,7,"[thing=206718][/thing] is an area control mixed with hand management. [thing=206718][/thing] has a high variety as not all races enter every game, thus often you get new and interesting interactions between the powers of them.

The mechanics are simple: on each turn, the person either plays a set of cards or draw a card - from the opens one (if any) or from the draw deck. Furthermore, depending on the ""leader"" chosen for the set, some special effect takes place: for instance, the Centaurs allow playing a second set of cards; the Elfs allow the player to hold cards in hand; the Dwarfs make the set be worth more at the end of the round; etc. Also the leader, by its color, gives the region on the board in which a control marker will be placed. The first marker needs a set of only one card; the second marker in the same region, requires at least a set of two; the third, at least three; and so on; making increasingly harder to sustain control of a region.

After playing a set, the player discard all the remaining cards still in hand to the open draw area, meaning the others (and even the person himself) will the able to draw them.

[thing=206718][/thing] is a well made and very functional game. Its turns are fast, and one play will clock around 1 hour. The level of interaction is high, with disputes for the regions as well as for the available open cards; but is worth mentioning that it isn't a destructive interaction: once a marker is placed, it stays there. Luck is present, and not in a small amount - it can even the decisive, specially due to some races that made discard less often and smaller, meaning more blind draws; yet, the luck didn't bothered us. The artwork by the great John Howe is awesome.

[thing=206718][/thing] is a pleasant game, relatively easy to learn and play, with its main counterpoint being that it needs 4 or more players to truly shine. For its variety and quantity of decisions packed in its short playing time, I recommend [thing=206718][/thing]."
1406,Tiets,9,"This game just went up again from an 8-9.  It is really good.  Fast, fun, variable.

But is not lulled down with 5 or 6.   So it is a great, still fast, and slightly bigger game, to bring out with groups of 6.

A superior game to TtR in every way except that the theme is at odds with the gameplay. This would work as a gateway game except you'll never get a  fantasy war game to the table with non-gamers.

1456,Valcurdra,3,"A light area control game that is incredibly bland and completely overshadowed by better games.

I love games that play fast and are easy to learn like this, so I assumed this would be a hit for me too, but man was I wrong.

The game play is incredibly boring with a huge proportion of the game just being a circle of people blind drawing of the top of the deck. The decision space is incredibly narrow, you really have minimal control over what you are doing.

Startlingly ugly, really an embarrassment to produce a game like this when other companies are going all out with production.

The powers of the different races add some interest to the game but considering how many top notch light games I own that are miles ahead of this, there really is no reason to bother with this nonsense ever again."

1462,vehmis,8.2,"Ethnos is an interesting but maybe a bit too simple and too luck based fantasy area control and set collection game. It's very easy to teach because of the simple rule set but it also doesn't get stale with repeat plays as it has a random setup for each game.

It always has multiple different scoring options you could viably be targeting but a lot of times it's really up to luck of the draw whether one strategy is going to be more efficient for you than another. Too many turns of Ethnos are spent on simply drawing a random card from the deck and hoping it's something useful - usually it isn't. Ethnos exists in a weird place where it has this kind of generic, dull and violent fantasy aesthetic that tries to appeal to D&D/LotR crowd but the gameplay mechanisms and depth of strategy are straight outta family style games.

It fits 4-6 players pretty well as the turns are quick and more players mean basically more cards to choose from on the table so you don't have to draw a random card from top of deck as often. With 2 players it was absolute shit because of the weird rules changes and random card drawing.

It's a game I bought because it seemed convenient. Easy to teach, scales well to high amount of players and replayability is high because of the random setup. It certainly ticks all of those boxes. It's also a game that's a lot of fun to play with the right group and right mindset. It's very casual but also allows for some clever cardplay and varied strategic approaches but those expecting some deep strategy and rich fantasy lore will certainly be disappointed."

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S) :
Jeu trop abstrait à mon goût.

Visuellement, je trouve que la thématique sombre donne l’impression d’un jeu de stratégie-lourd ce qui fait que les joueurs-experts pourraient être déçus d’y trouver un jeu plus léger qu’attendu tandis que les joueurs-débutants pourraient l’éviter par crainte de se trouver devant un jeu trop complexe alors que c’est plutôt le contraire.

À son tour de jeu, un joueur choisit 1 des 2 actions :
A) Piocher 1 carte du pool commun ou de la pioche qu’il ajoute à sa main.
B) Jouer jusqu’à 10 cartes de sa main puis mettre les cartes inutilisées de sa main dans le pool commun.
Du point de vue de cette mécanique, le jeu est très dépendant du hasard de la pioche et des cartes disponibles dans le pool commun ce qui pourrait déplaire à certains.

It has way more interesting choices than TTR while being basically the same game. I guess it could be a little complicated for some players, as I don't know why people in my game group kept not understanding what X means on the cards, which is mind boggling to me.
All in all, a very easy to pick up game that I would play anytime."
1480,Vost the Hood,8,+ Fairy Promo
1481,Vroenis,8.5,"Cultural notes: why did the artist/graphic designer literally shoplift the nation of Slovakia for the map?

I love how easy yet tactical this game is. For the most part, I don't mind the art either, nor the tokens. The only improvement it might benefit from is a more charismatic main board, but I still like it as-is.

The box insert, however, is nigh on completely useless, and I hate inserts designed purely for trade-show presentations (which is pretty much all of them). As a consumer, I hate inserts that are almost perfect but ultimately terrible due to bits falling out in transport or storage."
1482,Vrooman,7,"Cards are collected into sets simply by drawing them, similar to [thing=18100][/thing] or [thing=9209][/thing].  But when turning in sets there's the twist of giving up the remaining hand and making those cards available to other players.  Basic scoring is area majority and sets collected.  Games feature six of twelve available characters offering different strategies each game.  High points are simple and variable game play enabling big and quick multi-player games.  Excellent design, but feels a derivative mish-mash.  The thin theme emphasizes that point.  On the cusp of being a classic multi-player game, but needs more theme, conflict, or something.  Or maybe just more plays...."

Pros:

Simple card drafting game with some area control. 

I like how fast the turns move and that you need to be focused on the board all the time. 

Easy to teach and a good transition into more difficult euro games. 

Cons: 

The board and pieces look like they came from the 1980's. Not very well put together. 

No expansions created or put out there yet. 

Overall: I look forward to playing it a few more times."

 We played it in its finally published form, with the author of course, and it has been a very enjoyable experience.
 I think the aspects I prefer more about the game are its rhythm, its core idea, its simplicity and the tension it provides.
 It's always your turn, or so it seems, and you don't have ""dead"" moments.
 The sacrifice you need to make when you play cards and discard the rest of your hand is what I loved from the start and it's a very very good idea!
 Rules are quite simple and yet you have a lot of replayability thanks to the dozen different tribes.
 The thrill you have when waiting for the third dragon while you are trying to put that last disc is very exciting.
 
 Is the art that bad? Well, I don't think so. Drawings are quite nice even if not exactly my genre. I think the main problem is the colours are a bit dull and not discernible enough; also, they are quite sad while not giving enough ""epic"" feeling. Honestly, it's not so easy to tell apart one or two colours on the board. But the art itself is something more of a personal taste and I don't mind it so much: I love it when it's gorgeous but I don't care that much when it's not. I think I don't like very much the discs: they don't pile quite well. The rest of the material is of good quality.

The 0.03 is just to make my rating not so easy to guess."
1498,Weunty,N/A,6
1499,whatanonner,3,"On the up side, this game is simple to learn and quick to play. On the down side, it's just rummy and I don't know why anyone would think that is interesting. Also, since so many people have commented on the art... I think the art is great in a vacuum, but when you have hard to distinguish muddy brown images serving as the card's suit--the thing that needs to be immediately parsed at a glance--the art is not doing its job."
1500,whokan,N/A,Card drafting strategy euro of fantasy races to gain stacked area control and use the race leader special ability in a Smallworld-Ticket to Ride hybrid.  The unique coolness is the bittersweet completion of a warband discarded back to the central display that inevitably helps other players complete theirs.  Simple cool twist.
1501,wholton,5,Played at Dragoncon. It was pretty light. Didn't see enough depth for me to enjoy playing it more than a handful of times. Could be useful for occasions when I would want something fantasy themed that wouldn't take more than a few minutes to explain to new players.

1503,wiebeginter,N/A,201902
1504,Wigdogger,7,"After three plays, I found this to be a solid area majority and set collection game. The side components for certain races were also cool. I do agree that the blind drawing which eventually happens is a bit too random, but I also don't think this is a game that needs to be taken as seriously as a heavy Euro."
1505,wigrend,7.5,"Great area control game with a twist of push your luck. Slightly above gateway, but very pure. I enjoyed it."
1506,Willakhstan,8,"A better implementation of TTR mechanics, IMHO. Gives you a few extra elements to keep track of to add other layers of strategy, and the variable races really help with replayability. Ethnos also is a nominee for the Most deceptive box art award."
1507,WillBePlayin,9,"One of the bigger surprises in recent years! I really didn't think I'd like Ethnos all that much. The artwork, graphic design and colour choices are somewhat deterring to say the least but man do the mechanics work! Amazing, quick and fun. The game feels really short since the turns go by so fast.

I just wish the artwork, gameboard and the little chits were designed differently. This could've been a major, major hit in 2017 but falls short due to the awful look of the game. Maybe a deluxe edition somewhere down the road? I truly hope so."

1512,wills2084,6,To much set collection for my liking. Still fun to play though
1513,wilsonza,6,"Clearly some luck to the game based on the card draws. I'm also a little concerned that the Trolls are a little unbalanced. I also was surprised at the component quality for a CMON game - this seems way below their typical level of quality. Finally, the artwork felt bland to me when compared to ""prettier"" games with a similar theme (example, Small World). 

All of that said, this is a fun gateway game, a great area control that can scale 2-4 players, and a fun way to spend 45-60 minutes. All things considered, this one was a surprise 10 for me. Here's to hoping for a really nice Deluxe edition someday! :)

11/2018 Update:
The game has steadily slid down rating-wise for me as I've played it. To the point where I'm on the fence about keeping it. I like area control games and the theme, but don't like the components or art style. I enjoyed the card drafting and thought perhaps my kids would get into it, but they'd rather play something like TTR."
1514,Windopaene,7,"Simple, fast, clever and fun."
1515,wkover,4,"I keep rewinding the unboxing video so that I can watch the game be shelved over and over again. That's the best part.

A good portion of each session is spent blind-drawing cards. Who thought that was a good feature?*

Well, me, I guess - since I can end the game much faster that way.

*At least in Ticket to Ride you'll use your blind draws eventually.  In Ethnos most of them are released into the wild."
1516,WLMIV,7.4,"Good game. I watched a few reviews before buying the game. But the game deserves its reputation. The mechanics are quite simple, but there is much going on. The game should play quickly once everyone understands what they are doing. Sometimes, it is your turn before you even know it, so there is little down time. The game is about area control and card set collection. You collect sets to control the areas based on the color of the card or the type of creature on the card. When and how to develop the card sets is a part of the riddle. It is interesting how points are distributed through the three rounds. The first round is the longest and the second and third rounds are much shorter because you need more cards in order to place more influence on the board. As a result, the deck which acts as the time clock runs out much more quickly. How the points are distributed on the board, will influence where you play your cards and what type of sets you are trying to collect. The card you lead with has special powers. Knowing the special powers requires a little memorization although the basic information is on the card. The need to memorize actions leads to my only issue with the game. They should have cardboard aids for the specific powers of each type of creature in the game. When I have played with new players, more than once players who are unfamiliar with the game need to go through the rules for a full explanation of the creatures powers. This is a minor issue, but it would have been a nice touch to have. It is also true that just about any theme could be put on this game. If the magical lore turns someone who you might play with off, then I would advise against this game. The magical lore does not bother me and is a justification for the powers on the cards. It is the land of Ethnos and there is a clear theme that fits well with this game. I do see room for expanding this game by adding new cards, a new map, and possibly and/or new ways to score. However, expansions would depend on the success of this game."
1517,wojtast,7,"Area control Ticket to Ride 2.0 :) I was skeptical about the theme/artwork, but I ended up really enjoying this one. 
High on luck factor but there are some clever choices to be made.

Edit:
I let this one go. The uninspiring, generic artwork and theme didn't cut it in the longer run. I also found the fiddliness of deck preparation before each play to be kind of annoying."
1518,Wolfie6407,7.5,"Like: Rummy style cardplay, tense round ending trigger, Variable setup resulting in tons of replayability.

Dislike: Not incredibly intuitive gameplay, leads to some misunderstandings and ruined games."
1519,Wrecktangled,7.4,"Ethnos is the Ticket to Ride of area control and I think it does just that quite well. A bit much of luck when it comes to card draw, but its quick enough that I aint that bothered."
1520,WrigleyScott,9,"Probably the best CMON game that doesn't include minis. This is my favourite kind of game, in the sense that it epitomizes ""easy to learn, hard to master"". You either take a card or play a hand of cards - but timing is everything in this game. The little nuances are what make this game shine, like only using 6 out of 10 very distinct factions (increasing replayability) or the game ending on the third dragon card rather than simply running out of cards.

Plusy
+ Niski próg wejścia dla osób nie będących hardkorowymi graczami
+ 12 dostępnych ras, z czego w rozgrywce bierze udział tylko 6 co sprawia, że gra jest bardzo regrywalna bo każda z ras ma swoje własne bonusy. 
+ Bardzo proste zasady
+ Świetnie się sprawdza dla większej liczby graczy (od 4-6)
+ Realnie czas rozgrywki w wersji dla 4 graczy to około 75-90 minut co jest idealnym czasem by casualowy gracz się nie znudził.
+ Bardzo ładnie i solidnie wydana. Mimo tego, że nie ma figurek, to zastosowane żetony robią dobrą robotę.

Minusy
- Mało ""konfrontacyjna"", rzadko mam poczucie walki z przeciwnikiem o daną prowincję, raczej każdy gracz koncentruje się na sobie.
- Trochę słaby balans między punktami do zyskania za wystawione oddziały a punktami za zwycięstwa w prowincjach.

Podsumowanie
Gramy bardzo chętnie rodzinnie, najczęściej w cztery i więcej osób wówczas gra nabiera rumieńców. Świetna jeśli chcemy świeżą osobę wprowadzić do świata gier typu area control  z prostymi zasadami. 

Rozczarowani raczej będą hardkorowi gracze szukający czegoś bardziej taktycznego i o większym poziomie interakcji między graczami."

1539,ZackStack,7,"Pretty basic area control with a very unique card driven placement mechanism.  The cards you draw are largely random, but whenever you lay a set any left over cards go into a TTR-esque drawing line so there is certainly some luck mitigation to be had. There is also incentive in points to try to build as large a set as possible balanced against having the round end before you are ready for it which adds some nice tension.  The variable region scoring and large number of special power cards should add some nice extra replayability to Ethnos too."

Instead of just randomly drawing until you get the exact set combination you need (ala Phase 10, etc.) you usually will have to make a decision on whether it's worth the risk to keep trying for the bigger set giving it a more press-your-luck flair than dull deck milling.

The theming is a bit silly and hardly any of the races feel particularly thematic but they do add some decent variability to the game.  I really wish the game performed better as it would really be nice to get some expansion races for the game.  Also, I think the comments concerning the game's visual design to be fairly overblown."
