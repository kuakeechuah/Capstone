0,aarett,3,"played a demo of this at comic-con. very weak. replay value seems low and compared to the actual video game... makes board games look bad.  too bad they couldn't have skipped this and gone straight to a miniatures game.  maybe just a bad demo but otherwise among cmon games it ranks inbetween ""monstrous"" and ""gateway uprising."""
1,Axelay,5,"Rating after first game: 8 (lost after 5 minutes)

This game has a lot of cool mechanics but there are not a lot of quests to choose from.
The rulebook isnt clear enough for me and I had to watch playvideos.
I think there are a lot of good ideas but somehow the game doesnt feel 100% developed. But I want to give this game a chance and hope that CMON adapt these game mechanics in other future games and make it better.

Replayability seems low for me. But we will see...

I have to lower my rating after more plays. This isnt well play tested. It has a lot of good intentions but it fails.

Rating 5 (after 10 plays). Still didnt beat quest 1."

12,Civorimkum,9,It's a really fun game! The game looks gorgeous (because all the visuals come from the video game) and it's a lot of fun to play with your friends. The game is a little too easy and it can get repetitive be ause there about 10 different quests in total and you get to do 3 of them on every playthrough! Still... the experience is worth it!

17,dla133,9,I have other deck builders but none that play like this. The way the scene cards can flip and change the environment are a lot of fun and add a different dynamic. I’ve only played purely solo so far and the scenes and quests so far from a difficulty rating are about a 7/10. Looking forward to playing this more.
18,dmczyn,10,"Huge video game fun, bring a lot of expectation to this game and this game hasn't disappoint me at all!
It has high quality component and neat mech. It avoid the ""one-man-lead"" issue in most of the co-op games and you can feel involved in each game because you have your own deck and you will need to build your deck during the game.

Love the combination between DBG and Coop!"

40,KRWoods1,7,"I have not yet played the video game that serves as the source material.  That may add to my enjoyment a bit.  But on its own, this is an enjoyable cooperative experience.  My complaints go to the rules, which leave a lot of things to the player to figure out.  Also, since you play through three scenarios each game, and the game only includes 10, the novelty of the game may expire fairly quickly.  However, the game looks good and I enjoyed my experience."

47,MaskedGuido,8,Played @ Gencon 2019 - Pleasantly surprised by this game after the demo and a playthrough.  Bosses feel like puzzles - characters all feel different - light deck building elements.

49,Mozzik,5.5,"This plays a bit like the Dresden Files game (Where working out a plan of attach to take out a scenario as a group) with a bit less puzzle and a bit more deck building (Though not a lot of it), strapped to standard coop ""Do a good thing, then a bad thing"" gameplay loop.

The problems it runs into are that it doesn't seem very challenging, I think the replay value will quickly be consumed (10 scenes in the box and you play through three of them every time you play) and at least one of the two scenes we played ended up being very confusing to figure out and, assuming we read it right, it was also very trivial in difficulty.

It can also be surprisingly lucky given that attacks are often in the 3-7 range and defense is randomly between 0-5 so... results may vary.  A lot.

The deck building is also very light with little variance or interesting choices, you just don't loop through your deck that much and the decision to have all deckbuilding go to the top of your deck both mitigates this and reduces the value of the rest of your deck slightly."

53,Nalex222,7,"Another solid board game adaptation of a video game. There's a lot to like here. The rule set is simple, the gameplay streamlined and the mechanics innovative. The scene cards and your interaction with them are thematic and bring the game to life. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a much bigger game from CMON in the near future that uses the same ideas. The designers have done a terrific job with this and the overall production is great. My only complaint 6 plays in, is that it does feel a little on the easy side and once you've beaten all the scenarios a couple of times i'm not sure why you'd keep coming back."

The card game looks great and plays on some fun themes. I'd be curious to see how much replayability the scenarios offer, and how much the different playable characters change things up."
71,tikyjo,6.9,Love the combination of deck-building and cooperative battle game play. The ability to interact with scenery cards differentiates this from a straight-forward hack and slash cooperative battle-style game. The game can run quite lengthy.
72,toongl,8.5,"Very original gameplay, I really enjoyed the concept of the scenes cards that create a mosaic and the fact that flipping the scenes cards will change the way the scenes plays is awesome!  I get a strong video game feeling while playing this one and I think it's a refreshing experience. Really different from other deck builders. I found the artworks superb and it's a game I will definitely recommend to my friends.

Great solo experience too!!!"

74,uyric,7,"When I saw the 6.7 rating I thought it seemed too low. I'm giving 7, though, as now that I've written down my comments I don't see how could I raise that rating.

I've received this game a month ago and played it two times: first a 2-player game with Kratos and Freya, then solo with Kratos helped by Mimir and Atreus.

First of all, I'd like to highlight some points before going into details.
 - The game states it lasts 90 minutes, though I'd say it could easily go up to 120 min minimum, or even three hours for your first games.
- The first scene is probably the longest and most difficult. Your deck is weak and you draw a minimum of cards. It may take you up to one hour while you go through the mechanics of drawing, playing cards, resisting as best as you can, buying, drawing, etc.. When playing cooperative, you may discuss and help each other to survive this part.
- Once you get to defeat scene 1, the rest of the game seems just straightforward. You now have a better deck with stronger cards, you may have removed some of the initial and added some effects to draw more. In my solo game I ended up just drawing my entire deck every turn. Both times I played it I felt a bit disappointed by the fact I didn't need to bother any more about my resources, I've mainly just gone through the turns until every enemy was finished.
- The last boss represents a bigger threat, but once again is nothing compared to your strength at that point.
- In overall, I'm curious to play a few more times to test different combinations, but I'm not sure my friends will follow me on that.

Material:
- The pictures are awesome!! I'd give it 8 only for that. It would be a 9+ if the cards where of a stronger material, though they are good enough, with a paperboard that seems layered for resistance.
- Although I think the quality of the character board could be better, with a stronger paperboard, it has a good size and all the elements you care are clear to read.
- The ""miniatures"" are nicely done. The plastic bases may grip them hard, but at least they won't move.
- Good number of cards on the ""market"", although the effects seem quite repetitive after you've played a couple of times.

The scene mechanic:
 - At least a couple of stars flied away because of this. I bought the game because is God of War, that's it. When I first saw the scenes I was amazed by the art, probably taken from the last video game, and just looks good. All that made me order it straight away.
 - Unfortunately, flipping cards over and over again is exhausting. I remember crossing my fingers for the cards not to flip again, not to avoid the effect in the game, but to skip flipping it and having to make the whole picture match again. In some scenes you may even have a couple of layers, which make it even more frustrating.
- I've heard they wanted to include some exploration with this scene mechanic. I feel I lost some of the expectation when I was building the scenes on the table. During the first games I wasn't sure if I was putting them in the good order and so I flipped them to check, losing with it the element of surprise.

2+ player game:
- Kratos is punch, loose life, punch harder. If you get unlucky a couple of times and get hit by more than one enemy, you can easily get knocked out. That seems fair enough for the type of character, but makes the game too tough for him on the first scene.
- Freya was surprisingly good. As a support character I was expecting her to die after Kratos. My friend played it very nice, defeating the first scene by herself. As the knocked out player can still ""buy"" and draw cards, Kratos could help her once and keep building his deck at the same time.
- There is a fair amount of collaboration. The game doesn't propose to play open handed and so we didn't, which isn't bad as you don't have that much options to help each other. Freya has loads of support (violet) cards, but not the others.
- You need to speak to decide who goes where and who steps in front of the row to receive attacks. That seems like a nice and realistic battle interaction, though sometimes the wrong enemies may activate and crush you anyway.

Solo game:
- You are ""obliged"" to play with Kratos as main character helped by the back side of Mimir and Atreus. I'd like to try with other characters as well, though I don't know if it will be good enough to defeat the first scene.
- The powers of Mimir and Atreus, when used properly, are really strong. I don't remember running out of possibilities at any moment. Kratos lost life just a couple of times and he never was at risk.
- I felt I was mostly going through the mechanics, doing some forward thinking about which power to activate and when to recharge them, but mainly just going card by card in order to finish. Winning didn't seem that complicated. Even less after the first scene was finished.
- I accept I got lucky a couple of times, where if an enemy would activate it would've hurt me a lot. Then, in one scene you need to accumulate a lot of attack at once. I got lucky enough for my enemy not to recover afterwards, which could have been difficult to overcome.
- By the end of scene 1 and 2 I found myself just not wanting to defeat the scene right away, in order to buy some more and stronger cards.

I'm giving 7/10 because the game looks nice, the turns are fast and players don't need to wait for hours, I love deck building games and I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I'm still a bit concerned of how much will I want to play it in some months, when I'll have seen all the scenes and there will be no more surprises."
75,webchain,5,I have to agree with others that the game was not playtested enough.  I am still giving it 5 stars for the mechanics.  I REALLY hope someone else uses them to a better result.
