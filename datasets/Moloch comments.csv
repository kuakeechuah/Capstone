1,actmoon,8.5,"The sculpts and theme seems very well done. There are some nifty mechanics that separates it from other 1 v All. Seems to be in the depth/complexity between zombicide and descent/Imperial Assault. Should be able to bring to the table easier.

The game is very fun albeit having some rules abiguilty. Did not have to pull my punches unlike Descent second edition."

3,ajewo,N/A,"1 vs all cooperative dungeon crawler by CMON. The game is a streamlined collection of the best mechanics from many other dungeon crawlers (Imperial Assault, Level 7 [Omega Protocol], Zombicide). The depth comes through the many different special abilities, still it seems a bit lighter than the other dungeon crawlers. 
A big selling point of SMOG are the high quality components, streamlined gameplay, and story-driven campaign.
I really like the way how player elimination is handled and the back-and-forth initiative system which I would love to see in Level 7 [Omega Protocol] too. I like the theme and tactical combat system of Level 7 more (different stances and I am not a fan of defense rolls).

+ Artwork and Iconography
+ Weird theme (steampunk, magic, fantasy, England)
+ Components (plenty of detailed minis, custom dice, standees for the doors)
+ Modular board with cardboard  doors
+ Different scenarios with special goals. Campaign is not mandatory: campaign or scenario mode. 
+ Narrative campaign mode with great story transitions (intermission mini game, preparation for the next scenario) and character progress. Depending if heroes won or lost determines how the next campaign continues. 
+ Background stories for each character
+ Plenty of heroes and enemies units each with special abilities and different stats. Upgrade cards are used to level heroes up during campaign mode (variability)
+ A role card is assigned to each hero granting a further special ability
+ Many synergy effects between heroes' abilities which cause the heroes to stick together (cooperative play)
+ Heroes can find arsenal cards (equipment) granting further special abilities (new weapons or other stuff with boni)
+ Shared resource ""Ether"" (similar to Level 7 [Omega Protocol]: Nemesis player has power cards which can be activated at least once per round by spending ether. Heroes can move or attack. Special abilities cost ether which is paid to the Nemesis player.
+ Random one-time-use chaos cards for the Nemesis player (similar to Nemesis cards in Claustrophobia)
+ Turn order is determined by cards which are secretly played by both sides. Each card is revealed one by one and activates a certain unit (activation is back and forth: hero, nemesis, hero, nemesis ...)
+ Simple dice combat: attack and defense rolls: some symbols give choice (take ether or do action). Kind of group combat: adjacent units boost an attack.
+ Streamlined gameplay and quick playing time
+ No player elimination
# Requires a lot of table space
# Some hidden information: initiative, chaos cards
# Some luck: combat dice rolls, luck of the draw: chaos cards, arsenal cards
# Rules are okay, a lot of spelling errors. Updated rulebook and FAQ is available.
# Some expansions available with even more content (variability)
- Theme is weird
- I do not like defense rolls in a combat system :-/
- Retail edition lacks a lot of exclusive content from Kickstarter
- Like in many other successful Kickstarters, there is so much content to add variability, however, I wish the designers would have focus on adding more depth and deeper experience by creating unique moments instead of more of the same

Similar games:
* Imperial Assault (Star Wars theme, 1vsAll, similar combat skirmishes, campaign-driven, character progress)
* Level 7 [Omega Protocol] (Sci-Fi theme, 1vsAll, Adrenaline system similar to Ether, deeper tactical combat, scenario based, initiative system: hero and nemesis phase instead of back and forth turns between heroes and nemesis)"

36,craigetcooper,8,"What a surprising winner this game is - superbly executed theme and a campaign narrative that is genuinely engaging (and I'm not usually a steam punk fan); simple and straightforward gameplay that means you're off and running in the first 5 minutes; and the best CMON miniatures I have encountered - detailed but not overly fussy with a level of imagination that I haven't seen in other games (seriously, Phileas Fogg stepping out of another dimension?!?). I also appreciate the underlying sense of humour and the way it doesn't take it self seriously. You'll need the FAQ to work out some of the rules but nothing insurmountable as it's just not all that complex. All round a wonderful experience - currently my favourite game."

49,dinadingoldheart,2,"First off, the art is fantastic. The atmosphere...fantastic. Steampunk? I love it. All the components? beautiful. Spend resources and help the nemesis, great game concept! Leveling up your characters, nicely done!  CMON, great games, love them. Why a 2? Because of all the points mentioned, because the game itself? Never want to play it again. Totally broken, OP dice fest. No fun at all. The scenario's are the worst I've ever come across.

I've played all the scenario's from the base game, just because I was hoping I was wrong, (did anyone play test this game at al????) because everything about the game is something I want to love. But instead of having fun it's a horrible unbalanced totally dice depended, what shall I call it? Because it's not a game. First scenario, fun for the Gentlemen but no match for the nemesis player. I've played the whole campaign with  two players, wouldn't recommend it with more players because of the huge amount of downtime. Throw a dice, fail, next player, get totally blown away by the Nemesis player without the possibility to do something back, repeat.  But back on topic: scenario 1. Nemesis player angry because the whole scenario plays itself. 

Second scenario. I got lucky as the gentleman with the dice.  When I look online I'm one of the lucky few who won the scenario. And after that it goes down and down and down. One time we even put everything in favor of the gentleman, but again it wasn't possible to win at all! You have no influence or what so ever. Just sit down and accept the beating. No strategy, just throw some dice and pretend you have a chance. 

Scenario: ""here is a mission you can never accomplish. Feel week and helpless and throw some dice to give you the feeling of control."" Never in this whole game I felt like I had any influence on the outcome. It is so bad that even the Nemesis player wanted to quit, because there was no honor to gain. No fun, just frustration.

Nothing about this game is fun. The rules are fiddly, everything depends on dice and if you look online, nobody got further than the first two scenario's. So now I have a beautiful game that I never want to play again, but screams for community scenario's and rules. Worst game I have from CMON. And if you don't believe me, search for it and see how many games there are for sale for the lower price than we paid on Kickstarter. Or look at the ratings. 10 - comment own, 10 - comment own , 10 - comment own  . Yeah good reviews. (probably afraid that they can't sell their game) So a 8.1 is not a true rating. Don't be fooled by the high number.

If someone enjoyed the game, and played all the scenario's please let me know what your secret is, because without proper adjustments to the scenario's I will only play this game with my own rules and scenario's. Because the world and components scream for a good game. Shame on you CMON!

Now I accumulated enough hate to try that game ;)"

53,Dr Locrian,8,"Liking what I've seen so far, this is a provisional 8. I've no issue with the minis, which I think are excellent - I like the fact they are cast in different colours. Gameplay is actually quite simple, set up is about average for this sort of game, rulebook could be better with more examples. Gameplay is reminding me of a few other games, namely level 7 omega protocol, which has the programmed turns and I believe a type of currency that flows towards the baddy, this similarity is a good one, especially since this game is simpler. It also reminds me of claustrophobia with the nemesis board. Again this is a good thing, upgrades reminds me of rum and bones. The game is actually quite light, few issues with rulebook, I am not sure if rules are missing but it feels that way as the rules don't feel intuitively laid out, it would be a shame if that hurt this game long term as it's beautiful. Jury is out with future plays, will be hurt if balance seems off, but after one provisional play this doesn't seem to be the case. Kickstarter extras are nice.

Addendum: first and second scenario seemed to favour the gentlemen, the map tiles have icons (door icons) that don't map to the set up diagrams, so why have them?

A nice package that felt half baked."

The minis are amazing of course, and the theme is my kind of thing.
Still unsure. I have $1 in and will decide later in the PM I think. Something is telling me I should get this though....

I went for everything but the art book. I would have loved to get it, but funds were limited, and shaving off that 20 bucks helped me get the rest.

Looking through the minis and reading so many comments about how poor the quality was, I didn't have high hopes.

Anyone complaining about the casts or quality really has not taken into account the colour of the plastic - it washes out the detail and really lacks contrast. Spray them with gray, and you'll see how nice the sculpts really are.

Hardest PVC models I have ever seen and I wonder if it's mixed with ABS it's so hard. You can scrape the mold lines without pilling, which is amazing for PVC.

The rules look pretty easy and solid and again I don't understand the complaints. Yeah, there's 3 typos in the book. It's easy to parse and pretty concise. Real plays will tell.

As it stands this is a work of art.
Thumbs up so far.

Addendum:
Ok. Much better as you get used to the rules. Some corner cases exist, but I choose to err on the side of common sense. So, very little ambiguities if you roll with the most obvious choice - Spread is not that difficult if you use common sense. ie. bullets n' stuff can ricochet.

This is clearly a passion project, and it shows in every inch of the game, top to bottom. Some one poured their heart and soul into this game system and it shows. Now, if CMON would give this the exposure and support it deserves, I'm sure it would do very, very well.

The retail base box is great fun, so don't knock it if you can't get it all. Even adding a single expansion will add tons of replay and variety.
This is one game that needs, and deserves a widespread audience.

If you want the best 1 vs. All I have ever played, get this game."

First core mission played: (3x, for learning the game) 1 vs. 1 player. 

SMOG:ROM is a really fun, immersive and shortwhile 1 vs. Many beer and pretzels game. 
The core rules are easy to grasp and straightforward, while all the special cards used feel like they support and enrich (!) the use of core rules rather than negating, contradicting or unhinging them - the latter being a common pathological symptom of similarly setup game systems (like its worst offender XWING for example). I guess that's the benefit a complete splash release like SMOG is, over a collectible miniatures games cashcow (like XWING developed into).

SMOG:ROM is further dripping with theme and all around a shortwhile, fun experience which I'd happily introduce to any (including even the casual family) boardgamers; in comparison to (for example) Kingdom Death, which is aimed at more professional and regularly playing gamers due to the efforts you'd have to put into the latter.

There are some typos and some things aren't specified so I recommend going through that rulebook thoroughly before starting your first game. Also check out the FAQ released by CMON before playing and it the worst case scenario you can find some answers over here as well. - This is pretty much it for the negatives. I'd say the game is pretty balanced in most scenarios, with both the Nemesis and the Gentlemen having good chances of winning. I like the simple combat system with dice rolling because the game offers a lot of interesting tactical choices in other areas (movement, positioning, the order of your activation cards) and so it results in a nice combination of complexity and randomness. Replayability is also quite good especially for a scenario-based game. Each scenario has different conditions for a victory so I wouldn't mind playing one scenario multiple times. (I actually managed to play the first scenario 5 times already) Additionally, its theme is brilliant and unique – combination of steampunk Victorian era, necromancy and ancient Egypt. This game is a 10/10 for me if not taking that rulebook into account."

148,MegaMushroom,9,"Setting itself apart from many 1 vs all games, Rise of Moloch offers a genuinely interesting theme, gameplay that feels well balanced (it doesn't feel like the villain needs to pull their punches) and an interesting 'push your luck' mechanic where using the heroes special abilities makes the villain stronger. The production values are great, the art work is creepy as is the theme, and the miniatures are top notch. Definitely one of the more interesting games in the genre."
149,Mellekai,10,That is a hidden gem. One of the most beautiful games ever produced by CMON. And if you love one versus all gameplay it bestowed you with a well balanced and smooth gameplay.

Has all the usual headaches of Descent-type skirmish crawlers (fiddliness and LOS), but I find the theme much more enjoyable, and there's a bit less to keep track of.  The minis are great, of course, but I was very pleased with CMON's production of the cardboard and cards.  I usually find them very lackluster (Blood Rage, for instance) but the art, graphic design and paper/card quality are excellent here.  A keeper."

166,orion66,7,"I liked many elements of the game but it didn't take long to start feeling like a slog. Cards were great, powers were great, figures were great, etc, but after a while it felt like there was little tension. (Primarily in Chapter Two: monsters spawning too fast for heroes to make much headway, but monsters not powerful enough to do much harm to well-equipped heroes). I thought this could be fixed with little tweaks, such as a round cap. Chapter One, for example, I would suggest the bobbies have to keep the girl alive 4 or 5 rounds, then sun-up will turn the zombies to dust.  Might need to give a couple more plays to really decide. Also think it should be harder to heal/get rid of Torment cards. There were some neat cards, but they were so easy to get rid of they hardly had any value. I would say healing should be 2 actions instead of 1 and should be EITHER heal 3 OR get rid of 1 Torment card."

182,realityfoible,5,"I absolutely do not care for dungeon crawls, but even I have to admit that this is one of the better ones.

The art, setting, and models are excellent.  It's all generic steampunk, but somehow manages to come alive and tickle me in a way that a other generic steampunk games don't.  It just feels right.
Unfortunately, apart from the theme and a lovely mechanical twist on player initiative order, SMOG doesn't do much to evolve the tedious DNA of Imperial Assault/Doom/Descent, etc.
There's still clunky combat rules, massive down time between turns, few (if any) meaningful decisions to make, and the endless use of handfuls of dice with very little player agency to affect the outcome.

Still, this is one of the better ones."

I might revisit the game in 6-12 months to see whether a 40+ page FAQ/errata has been created to help adjudicate a myriad of ambiguous rules interactions. An intriguing setting with a simple core rules system, we wanted to have fun but it turned out to be a miserable slog trying to ascertain how we were actually supposed to play correctly."

200,Shoebargin,3,"Another broken game from the good people at CMON.  2 hours to set up! 2 hours to play 4 rounds! So much down time unless you are the Nemesis in which case you going like a hamster in a wheel! And yet another rule book that is difficult to navigate and just plain unclear in sections. I think we all just deserve better than this.

There are some nice things here, the theme is solid, art is good, interesting mechanic of powering up the bad guys by using your special powers but just too reliant on fluky luck with the turn of a card or the roll of a handful of dice.

But ultimately waiting half an hour to roll a few dice which hit or miss then settle in for another half an hour for your next go is just NOT FUN! Maybe this game is just for two players? It also feels like the Nemesis is going to beaten most scenarios (although I have only played the first three).

I kind of feel like the high ratings for this game are from all the poor people who have backed this on KS and just can't bring themselves to acknowledge that they have done their dough and are now having to suck the game lemon that Moloch is.

There are just so many better games out in the world and some nice art and cool mini's does not a good game make."

203,SisterV,10,Rated as Nemesis. No house rules. Can work for two but is harder to win as Nemesis because the opponents don't need to coordinate as they are played by the same person.
204,sithgecko,1,Kickstarter version with all add-ons.  This game will cause arguments unless you have a group of people who enjoy being tortured while playing tactical games.  Any decent Nemesis will easily overpower the Gentlemen players game after game.  If you are looking for casual gameplay with friends please look elsewhere.

Overall funny but with a lot of rule reading to the game make it a little bit slow.

223,Thronesmasher,8.5,"Well produced 1 vs many skirmish/crawler in a Victorian steampunk setting. The good guys control a handful of heroes and allies on a modular game board, trying to complete objectives. Meanwhile the bad guy controls a bunch of minions and agents, and has his own set of objectives.

The game is not too complex. The good guys alternate actions with the bad guy in a secret order. Actions are mainly move, and attack. Combat uses attack and defense dice, modified by gear and power ups. The good guys will really have to work together to complete their mission. The bad guy has some nasty tools to disrupt their actions.

It is possible to play the scenarios as a one off, or as a campaign. Both work pretty well. The scenarios in the base game are balanced, diverse, and replayable. The KS exclusives and expansions mainly provide new heroes and scenarios, which is great."

225,tmcclanahan,3.75,"My group's consensus after 5+ sessions is that we'd all rather read books or watch shows/films set in The World of SMOG universe than play this game. The only whisper of player agency is in between games of a campaign, during the intermission when selecting new gear & upgrades and then before the next game when selecting Gentlemen and distributing gear and roles—everything else is just slowly and painfully watching handfuls of dice play out a predetermined plot.

I'm thinking of suggesting that, if we want to try one more session, we play without rolling the dice; just treat everything as successes. Maybe we can get through the game fast enough that people's long downtimes don't suck them into their phones, and maybe we can focus on the only thing the game does well: Theme. 

Except that despite people saying the game is ""dripping with theme"", we find that the theme is almost entirely decoupled from the gameplay & mechanics—we have beautiful minis & artwork, sure, and there are character bios that are okay-to-well written, and sometimes the page or so of story leading into a game seems to be interesting, but then the gameplay is totally generic and all that theme falls by the wayside as things like character, motivation, setting, et cetera are replaced with stat calculations, lines of sight, and endless randomization by dice and cards. The closest thing we've noticed to theme having an impact on gameplay is that one of the Gentlemen, who for some reason is wearing a full [metal] dive suit above the water, moves a little slower as a result."

247,zgabor,6.3,"Nagyon jó látványvilággal és történettel megspékelt dungeon crawler, mely kifejezetten jó játékmenettel is büszkélkedhet. Az overlord (Nemesis), ha nehezen is, de legyőzhető, de legalábbis jó néhány esélytelen helyzetből ki lehet jönni, így nagyon izgalmasra sikeredett mind a két játszmánk (1:1). A kockadobásokra nem sok módosítás van, így szokás szerint az arra hajlamosaknál a rossz gurítások sajnos el tudják rontani a jókedvet, de azért együtt lehet élni vele, emiatt kár kihagyni, ha egy kicsit is tetszik a téma. ;)

A következő két játék már rendesen lerontotta az élményt. Az egy dolog, h rosszul dobtunk, de olyan szinten lejtett is a pálya az overlordnak, h szó szerint, esélyünk sem volt a győzelemre. Ezt ugyan belátva az elsőt elég hamar feladtuk, de reménykedve és új taktikával felszerelkezve visszavágót követeltünk. Menthetetlen volt itt is a dolog, így keserű szájíz maradt utána.
