2,alexsis920,6,"Can be fun, and the kid (6) always wants to play, but the grown ups usually try to get her to choose something else instead."
3,arod324,7,"Surprisngly more fun than I thought it would be.  There is an interesting gameplay in terms of trying to do something descriptive versus trying to go through many cards.  I enjoyed the speed improv and spontenaity of it, but I imagine a lot of people would hate the memory aspect of it.  "

8,cmicha,2,"This is not a game at all but an activity. It is either a mindless flipping of cards and describing the picture or a convoluted stream of rambling nonsense. The ""scoring"" doesn't work at all as the volume of cards placed can vary widely and the fewer cards placed, the lower the outcome."

Un jeu coopératif fun, original et beau qui fonctionne avec tout le monde."
14,gdaudin,9,A great game to play with kids - among others.

16,HapaxLeg,6.7,A filler that works wonderfully with loud groups of imaginative players. 
17,hiyou,6,ストーリングテリングゲームの評価方法としてメモリー要素を用いていてそれがうまく機能している。印象的な話にしたいが一方でたくさんのカードを出したい。いいジレンマ。

Can be played with anybody, and most surely will be a success. "

23,Kether1983,5,"Aki szereti a történetmesélős játékokat, annak jó választás lehet. Én nem annyira vagyok oda az ilyenért, de nem rossz rendszer, legalábbis a pontozós része nem olyan erőltetett, mint sokszor az ilyen kooperatív célpontszámot használó játékok esetében. Az, hogy nincsenek saját körök, picit zavaró lehet, mert bár jól hangzik, hogy bárki bármikor kijátszhat lapot, az azért oda vezethet, hogy egy-egy játékos nagyon elnyomhatja a többit."
24,kissgg,6,"Initial rating after 2 plays. I liked the mechanism of the game very much. What I didn't like are the stories that emerged from the gameplay. They were really stupid, arbitrary and uninteresting, with no narrative arch whatsoever. And I think it was not our fault for the most part, but the fault of these too simplistic cards. I think a better card deck would result in better, more exciting stories. I will give this game system another try with cards from Once Upon a Time, Ace Detective and/or Dark Cults."
25,KRWoods1,6,"This is an interesting cooperative memory and story-telling game.  It is fun with kids, but I doubt it is something I will return to very frequently, as there are better story-telling games and better memory games out there.  Still, I did enjoy it."
26,KubaP,8,"Memo? Seriously? Well, SERIOSULY! It's a fantastic memo/storytelling game that shows you the true power of your brains!"

33,Ohkapi,9,"All players I have played with said they had a good time playing this, they laughed when they knew they have to construct the dreams all over again! When I see people smiles and laughing, that made me love the game more.
Plus I like twisting rules, in this case I play this solo a lot, by myself, I look at this as a training memory + presentation stories skills tool kit. Great game/tool and happy the cards have zero words, like Dixit! cards but simpler and smaller.   

The alarm clock in this version (Traditional Chinese) I purchased is just wonderful. LOVE this."
