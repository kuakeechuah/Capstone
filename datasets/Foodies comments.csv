0,AndySzy,6,"Light filler dice roller. Feels a bit less substantial than Machi Koro or Space Base. I think what I'm missing for this is the ability to stack spaces - you're only ever going to activate one card when you hit a number, so you can't do the risk/reward of making one number awesome or spreading it out... You'll be spreading it out."

2,biasedisland,6,"My wife and I really enjoyed this the first time we played it at a local con. Thankfully though we ended up just renting it from our library afterwards and didn't buy it straight out. It's a fun engine-builder with dice and a nice theme (I love food), but there's just not enough depth or replayability for us to purchase it. I hate saying this, but it's probably better for more than 2 players.  "
3,blutovs,7,"A light game that can serve as a gateway to engine building.  For a 30 minute game, I like it a lot."
4,buckbagr,7.4,"Fun, fast game.  I didn't know Cmon had it in them.  Very simple game with fun choices that plays out very quickly.  Perfect game for introducing someone to the hobby.  Not too much to think about, but choices do matter.  It plays out so quickly that you'll play a couple of times every time you bring it out."
5,danperrault,6,"Sometimes I want to sit back relax and play a game where I make some choices but the randomness plays a big role.  I like when these games are shorter and this does fit the bill.  

Vs Machi Koro the art is not as pretty but is good.  the game play is better and the length is a little shorter.  

Vs space base it is shorter and is less of a space hog.  Randomness seems similar in both games.  I enjoy space base but do hate how all the cards slide around.  You do get the big turn in space base that feels great.  Big turns are smaller here.

The ridiculous insert.  How can game designers not understand that boxes may tip 90 degrees.  This beautifully organized box becomes a complete tornado strike by simply putting it on your shelf or stuffing it in your bag to bring to a friends house."
6,davkus fochuckle,8,I played a Demo at CMONexpo this year.   It seems a little like space base or machi koro.  I liked it a lot.  It seems like it would have good replay value since you don't have the same sets of cards every time.

15,Hribr,N/A,"2 - 5 players (best 2 - 5), 20 - 30 min, Age: 14+

In Foodies, players take on the role of managers in a food court. During the game, they will add new dishes to their menu, connecting the stars between different dishes. These recipes come from all over the world, granting different bonuses when added. What's more, players can hire chefs to work in their kitchens, including special, prestigious chefs who are the best in the business. In the end, the player who gains the most popularity will be declared the food master and win the game."
16,huffa2,8,"Apr20: this is a super fast engine builder that is the best machi Koro type game hat I’ve played. A couple of things missing from rules and it may be too fast, but at the moment I think it’s very fun.
May20: after more plays I have upped my rating by .5 it’s so quick and replay able and fun."
17,janbig,2,"One of the most boring experiences I've had in a while. Absolutely no agency or control over what's happening. It's the type of game where you sit back and let the game play itself.

I've never tried Machi Koro or Space Base, but if they are anything like this...no thank you."
18,jgunnz,6,Very basic Machi Koro-style game. Maybe best as a family-weight game.

20,joelpetersen,8,"Much better than Machi Koro and Space Base, and plays in half the time, even with 5 players"
21,Jonty Dante,6.86,"It is a light game that doesn't take too long. Little in difficult decision making. Roll, take money, buy a new dish. Good for a little light filler, nothing to write home about. Best at 3-4."
22,JSMullins87,6,"Positives: Very streamlined. This would make for a great gateway game. Another game in the Machi Koro vein where you get resources on everyone's turn. This makes everyone engaged for the whole game - even not on their turn. This is a big plus. Also my wife really liked it. This is always a giant plus.

Negatives: Really light. Not as much variety as I would like either for a game this light. We played twice and saw all of the different stalls in the game. I'm sure the different combos would switch the game up a bit but the powers are all pretty similar. 

Overall: Not a great or a bad game. The fact that my wife liked it means it'll likely stay in my collection. I also think the theme is approachable enough to be a mainstay for bringing new people into this wonderful hobby!"
23,Karujin,7.5,Fun game. It feels a bit random especially at the start of the game. I would probably like it a bit more if players started with couple dishes. Other than that plays well.

26,larryjrice,2,"FIRST IMPRESSION:

Maybe we did something wrong but this one was over before it even started for me. Being last player felt like a significant disadvantage. Rules were a bit murky about some aspects of game play. Just felt sloppy and not quite there. I have no interest in revisiting this one again."

31,MarkyX,7,"It's a decent light family game that are good alternatives to games like Machi Kori and Space Base.  While I found those two games to take way too long for their simple mechanics, Foodies hits the right spot between complexity and game length.

However, this doesn't mean the game is great.  It's a decent filler, but I find most of the ""strategies"" in this game too be far too straightforward to me.  You are essentially creating your own little ""bingo card"" and trying to set up combos by using the abilities of different cultures to net big results.  You also have to worry about cash because you need to draft your cards and want to hire chiefs to get more points.  There is a bit of a struggle to get to your destination, but it isn't much of a challenge to overcome

I don't mind playing it if suggested and I did it enjoy it more than Space Base and Machi Kori, but I prefer other light filler games within the same time length such as Skull King, Cat Lady, and Point Salad."

I also don't like that it's basically Machi Koro/Space Base (Roll dice, get stuff, hope to get lucky).  There's nothing wrong with those games, clearly they have an audience, but it's not me."

41,oppedj02,5,"This is a Machi Koro-esque game where players roll dice to trigger cards in their tablaeu, then use coins earned to buy more cards. It's lighter than machi koro, imo, if that's possible. Not a lot of variety in the foods that will be used each game. A decent, light game to bring out with casual gamers."
42,Orphebus,4,"Preliminary opinion:
Entertaining, you play on everybody's turn. Very light and lucky, very few possible combos. It's all about building a nice star pattern and getting the best center tile gives you a great shot at winning."

46,punkin312,5,"Easily the best game in the ""Machi Koro"" family. Has the same style game play, but is more refined and has a definitive ending. Still not a favorite genre of game, but I could play it if requested."
47,rainydaysteve,8,Played an early copy at CMON Expo and loved it. The game hits the target play time (25 minutes or so) perfectly and delivers a thoughtful game in the process. Lots of fun and I think that this is one that will get to the table regularly with a variety of friends and family.
48,Redd85,6,"I'm surprised this came from CMon. I love most of their games, but this one is just not that fun. There is no universe in which I would play this over Space Base. "
49,riddell,5,"Most like Valeria: Card Kingdoms where you get something on every turn (also like Space Base, Machi Koro where you might get something on every turn...). You can assign cards to numbers unlike these other games. Adds a spatial element that makes it matter where you put the cards since you want the stars to line up. Shorter, but sadly not as much fun for me as these other three. I think this is due in part because you can't play the odds with only one die. Also, the card payoffs seem somewhat uninspired and they only significantly vary by nations (and there are only a few of those in each game). Lastly, the theme never came through for me. It felt like just gathering money and cards to get more money and points."

62,Thunkd,7,"Foodies is a dice game along the lines of Machi Koro or Space Base. You have a player board with spaces numbered 1-9 which mostly have some default cash payouts of 1 or 2 coins (although a couple of those spots only pay out once).

On your turn you roll a d10 and everyone triggers that space on their player board. Initially you just get some money, but as you start adding dishes to your player board, they'll do cool stuff. If you roll a 10, you decide what number to trigger. There's also some ""flyers"" which you can use to adjust the die roll (but only for yourself).

Then you buy a dish from the public tableau. Dishes come from one of five cuisine types. There's more than 5 types of cuisine in the game but only five are in any given play. Cards start at $3 and get more expensive, so new cards are pricey and stuff that's been sitting around gets cheaper. A lot of the game is about how you combo your dishes to work together.

Additionally, every dish has a partial star on one or more of the edges. If you combine these to make a full star then rolling the number for either of the cards that make up the star will generate a point for you. If you can make multiple stars on a single space that could be an extra 3 points (possibly 4?) every activation.

In my play the dishes were:

Mexican - which we spicy and gave you money for all the spicy dishes you had

Thai - Spicy and gave you points/money for spicy dishes orthagonally adjacent

French - Paid you points if you had the most French dishes

Italian - I honestly can't remember what these did. Maybe put points on adjacent cards?

Something else - ??

You play the game until someone hits 20 points and then you finish the round. Whoever has the most points wins.

There's a couple of special chefs you can hire. One is always available and the other two you can only trigger once per game. These are mostly ways to give you points. The two special guys in our play gave points for building dishes in the shape of a cross and having one of every cuisine type.

I wanted to like this game a lot... but it was over so quick! You didn't really have much chance to set up an engine before the game ended. I felt like there was supposed to be a lot of getting combos and running your player board, but that barely happened before the game ended. Maybe it was just this play, but if it's always this quick I'd be a little disappointed. An alternative could be to play to higher point total. My understanding is that with fewer players you use a higher point total, maybe it's better with fewer players for that reason?"
