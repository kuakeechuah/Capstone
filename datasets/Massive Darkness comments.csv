3,acolyte,7,"Massive Darkness has some really fun dice rolling combat, a fantastic loot system, and a great level up progression within a single scenario.

It does take a bit longer than necessary.  And I have to say this game is WAY overproduced.  The minions are basically glorified health trackers.  I wouldn't buy this myself but I'd enjoy playing it again if it went faster."
4,actmoon,N/A,"Excellent components. Good gameplay in general, may require minor house rules depending on what you are expecting from the game. The game is a very good sandbox for tweaks as well.  By default it's a great dice chucker and thematic.

Edit: house rules might be needed for solo play at later quests 
At 3-4 players no house rules are needed so far (quest 1-3)"
5,adrientyler,6,"Matériel très sympa, mais gameplay relativement simple.

6,Aenoch,6,"The minis are great (that was expected). Other game components are good.
Gameplay wise I must say I am a bit disappointed. It really feels easy, You don't really need to plan ahead, it's a total dice chucker. I think it doesn't have the magic I felt in other dungeon crawlers I played (Descent 2nd edition, Sword & Sorcery).

I think it can be a good game to play with friends when no one wants to play a heavy game but just roll some dices and spend some time together. I would not recommend it to play solo, and even less if you look for a challenge.

Edit: sold it. Gets way to fiddly past half the game. You spend more time counting than playing"

28,andrewflansburg,7.5,"Individual games are fine but it takes too much time deciding what new weapon to use or whatnot because in the first few rounds you need every advantage you can get. The first door is always the hardest. Mid to late game you're making paste out of all the minions. 
In campaign play I'd suggest only running 5 games as the micro experience is 1/5th normal. EITHER RUN THROUGH THE EVEN OR ODD numbered quests as the higher numbered quests have more artifacts which grant more actions. Besides either quest 9 or 10 would be a good finale if you weren't overpowered. We ran the whole 10 and lost one of the first few but pretty much didn't need to think about any situation. Whoever got to the minions or monster first got the kill. I played a sorcerer, by the end I was pushing 10+ auto wounds. (Bypassing defence if that mattered.) my highest damage output in one attack was 20 and the battle Wizard matched it once. "

Gameplay is light, easy to learn and fun. We didn't try the campaign mode yet. Some minor criticism is that the number of classes and hero types (tank, range dd, melee dd, magic dd and healer) doesn't seem very well balanced. If I remember correctly there are 2 range dds, 2 healers (which are basically useless) and maybe 4 magic users. The remaining 13 heroes are melee dds or tanks. also out of 9 classes there is 1 ranged dd, 2 magic users, rest melee dds or tanks. This could have been balanced better so all the melees don't have to fight over weapons so much. The dice chucking combat also makes combat very random. You can do anything from 0 to 15 dmg and get the same from monsters. Getting hit almost certainly kills heroes at the start of the game while at the end you basically just one-shot everything. "

But.
There is the core of a fun game in this box: a dungeon crawler that can offer a full power-romp in only one session without the n-th worthless campaign which only purpose is to slow down the enjoyment of the game. This game has the basis of fast,fun, carefree combat, with a ton of nice loot and flavor, so let's hope this wasn't chalked as a mistake by CMON and a 2nd edition (with an appropriate conversion kit) is released for it."

But while it is not a complex game, the information is spread to the winds so it is time consuming to make sure combat is being resolved properly. I think in my mind that is its biggest downfall...what should be simple and fast gets bogged down with making sure all the relevant elements are being observed. Zombicide Black Plague does a better job of being fast and simple (but it doesn't feel epic). I guess fast, simple, AND epic is really hard to do. Massive Darkness is instead not-as-fast-as-it-could-be, very simple but hard to wrangle, and reaching for epic while not really coming close. So gameplay is 7/10. Components are 9/10...the minis are mostly awesome but some of the heroes fall short and are off-scale or stylistically out of place."

The campaign mode is a bit of a let down but it does make the game a bit more challenging as the skill progression is slowed down quite a bit.  The difficulty of the first quest seemed to be perfectly balanced; it kept us all in suspense and never felt too easy or too difficulty.  Our party wiped out at the last room because our beat-stick barbarian got a little to full of himself and the paladin was not close enough to jump in front and take the beating.

125,bucklen_uk,9,"Provisional rating, I'm experimenting with house rules to improve the 'story mode'.

Basic game out of the box is fine (and a 8/9 for me) but I want the linked quests/progression. As it stands the story mode doesn't work (well 2 player anyway), you level too fast and get too much equipment meaning after a couple of quests you're  almost max level ...

Fortunately this is the usual CMON sandbox game, so there is lots of opportunity to customise it to what I want :)

* Update, yep Story mode as per the rules is junk - characters level up far too quickly, mobs die far too easily (at least in 2 player), you get flooded with equipment. All of this is fun in regular mode, but story mode just doesn't work. It feels tacked on and rushed, needing more development :(

Shame, had lots of promise. For now an '8' but if I get story mode working with a set of variant rules it may go up.

** Update, despite reservations still playing this - and tinkering with house rules to 'fix' story mode. Base game (pick a quest and done) is fine, and I think better than Zombicide BP, but I really want the linked quests/story progression. For now it's up to a 9, and if I crack it probably a 10.

*** Update, yep now a 10 with my variant rules :)
https://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/w8c6y8oc0a/MD_variants.pdf

**** Update - most played game now, and I'm working on random quest generator after having gone through the official quests (although I'm fine redoing them with a different set of characters). Solid 10 but only if you're prepared to house rule the 'story mode' which is just broken after about 3 quests if you use the rules as written :/

***** Update, still love the minis, but not getting played - unlike ZBP which still gets pulled out for occassional games. Rating dropped"

130,caballero1321,6,"The game and mechanic itself is pretty fine. Unfortunately, campaign turned out to be a huge disappointment to me (maybe because I got spoiled playing Descent, and especially - Gloomhaven).
In the beginning, the game is pretty tough and it's fine (although, sometimes, you get deleted because of some unlucky card draw or dice roll). Later, we often (usually play in 2-3 players' team) encountered a situation where either we deleted enemies with a single blow, or one of us got deleted with a single blow.
Another downside is the lack of diversity of monsters - the same monsters over and over again - gets pretty boring soon.

I played 5 different scenarios only, so far, but planning to give it another try after a few months break and update the comment / rating."
131,cadblur,3,"Update. Sold.
I wanted to like this game so much. Had high hopes as we love Black Plague. The problem is that there are much better games out there. Sword and Sorcery, The Undercity, Shadows of Brimstone, Gloomhaven and for an evening RPG experience Gloom of Kilforth.
The biggest problem (for me) is that the game feels like a chore. I really dislike the scaling factor by multiplying the number of heroes to set the health of bosses and agents and to a lesser extent using the same multiplying formula for deciding the number of spawning minions. 
If you are in Asia and interested in the KS edition shoot me a message. Nevermind ... already sold."
132,Cadesh,2,Game is sadly extremely disappointing. The game is very simplistic and tedious. There is no risk reward in the game. Progression in the game is very poor and you become godlike very quickly. Even the strongest monster in the game doesn't have any way to kill the players once you are about half way through any of the quests. Sadly I will have to create my own rules to make this game even moderately satisfying. I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

145,cbazler,6,"Pretty disappointed, even if I still have fun playing this. Like its zombie predecessor, the game is simply too easy, especially now that players get a resurrect option. Most enemies aren't that difficult to defeat, and treasures are way too abundant; although they tried to scale the game for player count and limit search actions, there is still simply too much free loot for the characters.

I really hate the new ""transmute"" action: it not only makes the game easier, but makes it far more fiddly, having to constantly rummage through cards. It also makes no thematic sense: ""I'm going to magically turn this sword and potion into a shield... without using an action!"" It's a testament to the poor design that so many BGG users have come here to ""fix"" or improve the gameplay with house rules.

Nevertheless, I still think it's light, trashy fun, and as a fan of Zombicide: Black Plague, I like the crossover material. The minis are awesome, and the theme comes across well enough. I can't say the huge expense is justified, however, for what can't be described as anything more than just a ""mediocre"" game."

Still enjoyed it as a tutorial.  The first real scenario is a bit long for what it provides but was fun to play.  Third with time pressure was much better gaming experience with more tension.  I can see that the event deck needs a bit more likelihood of a monster and I think I'm going to add at least +1 creature to each mob spawn (if not +# = to tile number).
I'm also very glad I bought the whole thing.  The base random monsters are solid but the expansion ones are really fun.  Air elemental and cockatrice are particularly fun.  The oni with a shield was hard to bring down.  I think HP = modifier x (#heroes + tile number) will probably how I home rule it.
Overall though, very fun for what it intends to be: a very light dungeon crawler."
150,ChaplainSeverus,5,"Game really lacks drama or intensity. Lots of things to remember. And in most games I either get wiped out early or just steam roll through the dungeon. The Boss monsters and high level roaming monsters just get torn to shreds.

So many good components, just lackluster design. No desire to play the campaign. Hey you learned a skill! But you forget it until you get to the appropriate level of the dungeon to balance it. . . :("

It's too simple for a gamers game.

164,Coaldrone,8,"A fun, somewhat forgiving dungeon crawler with a huge range of detailed miniatures that made the kickstarter pledge well worth it. The game itself becomes a tad tame once you get used to how the monsters activate, and normally by the time your party is approaching the final stages of a dungeon, you will be so armed to the teeth that even the greater roaming monsters can perish in one good round. 

I highly recommend homebrewing rules such as: removing all good events from the events deck, allowing guardians to mulligan one treasure if they draw one they cannot use, permadeath (although this will result in player elimination which is not that fun), etc etc. I do not regret kickstarting this at all, have played it several times and plan to potentially use the minis in future DnD campaigns. The darkness is massive, and full of terrors, but our shadow barbarian had a level 5 greatsword so now they're all dead."

This has some very good design upgrade compared to Z:BP like the XP system, counter attack system, no friendly fire, trash loot transmutation etc. It is not easy at all. I'm really happy I've backed this one. I even considered to sold Z:BP because what I liked in that game I get from this one too with upgrades.

Update:
At the end, it fails as a campaign game. It is definitely too easy during a campaign.

227,dinadingoldheart,9,"What a fun game it is. It's smooth, plays fast, is fun and intense. Why not rate it a 10, because the rules and the components (mini's) are worth a 10? Well it's the missions. They are really bad. In the intro scenario you are already king of the game, just to discover in mission 2, you can't use any of your cool stuff. The story is none existing, no fun and dry. They just pasted in some random story. You can tell because after the scenario's there is another section of the rules. I didn't even read them at first because I thought they were done explaining the rules.

Does that make it a bad game? No, not at all. It is so easy to create your own random dungeons, make up your own story and have tons of fun with battling monsters, making tactical decisions and leveling up that this is my favorite sandbox games in years. But....it's not meant to be a sandbox game. So although I love the game how I play it now myself and having fun with it and want to play it over and over, it's not worth a score of 10 because it wasn't intended the way I play it.

Should I buy it? Should I play it? Definitely Yes! But create your own adventure, it will give you ours of great fun! Use your imagination and you will never be disappointed. Do the missions and you will get bored, frustrated and missing out a super fun game!"
228,dingoswan,5,"I hate to rate this game so considering I was a Kickstarter supporter, but it is simply too fiddly. The combat basically boils down to dice rolls like many other games such as Descent, yet you have to keep track of modifiers on five different or more different cards to determine your outcome: your character's card, your class sheet, your gear, your enemy's card, and their gear. It's simply too much to keep track of and slogs the game down entirely. 

Like many others have commented, I think the idea of making a Diablo-style board game sounded great on paper (made me drop $250+ on it), but the fiddly complexity doesn't translate to cardboard. I believe Arcadia Quest has a much more refined yet similiar system which is much more enjoyable to play."

230,djberg96,5,"Read through the rules, did one solitaire scenario, and could already see the issues that ratimir and others brings up in their comments. Essentially, too heavy and fiddly a set of rules for what ultimately is light (and repetitive) game play, minis that are really little more than HP markers, and once you get past level 2, it becomes too easy.

It's a shame, too, because the minis are really nice, and the ability to hide is something I've not seen in similar games. Other dungeon crawlers should borrow that. But, if I want something light I'm going to go with [i]Ravenloft[/i] et al, and for something heavier I think [i]Descent[/i] wins out."

240,Dr Locrian,6,"Some mention of the game being a bit easy particularly at the lower counts has been experienced, however it's still been fun. Balance issues are worse in competitive games, and though it's good to be challenged, two hour coops that end in a damp defeat leave a sour taste, so I dont care about the balance, the fact it works at all is quite impressive as there's really a lot going on in this game, but it's about as trim as I think it can be. The different classes, the loot system and the ai monsters are all good in my opinion. The map tiles are gorgeous, the game works mostly around cards rather than tokens, which I prefer, though makes the game a massive table hog - as you might have expected from the title. It does feel like an evolution of the Black Plague system, however I largely prefer that game. 

This game game has the advantage of not requiring you to control multiple heroes at the lower player count unlike Black Plague. It's perhaps a richer, and a more complicated game, with a large variety of enemies. It has the long set up, and also the rule book which is designed for reading but not cross referencing from. The minis are also great  and there is a lot from them. I would even say that you could happily just play the core and feel like you had enough variety. 

However, Black Plague is simpler and more fun in my opinion. I find myself wanting to play it over this. The fact that the zombies just suck up hits without defence rolls, speeds up everything in that game, and the ai is simpler to run. I am not necessarily saying this is better: it just leads to a better game experience in my mind  that can be shared with a greater variety of people. The games are similar enough that I don't feel the need to own both long term. I haven't tried the campaign and probably never will, I generally don't really delve into that side of games, so perhaps I am missing out. The wizard is my favourite."

Heroes looking for cool gear, constantly swapping them out looking for better and cooler combinations frantically slashing through enemies looking for even more and better gear. For those looking for a dungeon crawl you need to look elsewhere because this game has more to do with video games and arcade games than a board dungeon crawl. And I think that's where the game failed to deliver, on expectations. If CMoN emphasized the arcade nature of the game, that it had closer ties to Gauntlet and Diablo it would make more sense. For me, I'm just waiting for shops to clear out stock at a discount so I can finish up the few items I'd like to round everything out. "

Final turns wind up being you standing toe to toe with whatever poor monster just spawned while you pound it into submission in a single activation.

Much of its problem is that the story/game play is so linear. Open room A, open room B, open room C etc. The roaming monster spawn in the same space/one space in front/one space behind. The heros have to hack through the monster, as the tactical decisions are relative simple. Yes BP is a somehow simpler, but that is one reason it plays more diverse. And I wanted MD to be diverser in gameplay, not in figures and rules. Massive Darkness is a nice Hack&Slash game I'll play, when I'm in the mood. The game as such will though one day be one of many."

281,EmperorOfDoom,8,"Core box with default rules (4):
If i would would have to rate this based on the core box and default rules it would be very bad. There just isn't enough variation in the core box, not a lot of heroes and horrible balancing.

My rating (8):
For me personally it rates pretty high because i got a good deal on a kickstarter pledge with black plague crossover set. Allowing me to use black plague zombies and heroes in this game as well as have all the kickstarter stuff from massive darkness (heroes, expansions, tiles, quests and lots of roaming monsters. This combined gives a lot more variations, 11 classes, like 30 heroes and large decks of roaming monsters (since most of them were kickstarter exclusives).

Default balancing is horrible and only challenging if you have bad luck on the first two tiles and after level 3 you snowball out of control. It also gets hellish in calculating each combat roll. 
So the rating is also based on using the following custom house rules:
- Transmuting 3 items gives u one item of the same level instead of one level higher.
- U can only keep 1 treasure of each treasure pile you find and have to discard the rest.
- Every monster gets 1 extra health per depth level of the dungeon, so plus 1 health on level 2, plus 2 health on level 3, etc.
- All skills cost double the xp listed on the class sheet (limits the amount of calculations during battle and reduces snowball effect).
- Monsters always keep drawing till they find a weapon/armor and will always use it even if they never had stats in it before.
- Some more custom changes in monster behavior to make them harder.
- Artifacts are never used (they are just to powerful)

Just to be clear I have not tried story mode because I heard it was rushed in and is even worse in balance so don't expect to much of story mode."

Mapas lienales, por lo que no puedes esquivar enemigos, o vas hacia delante o hacia detras, y cuando te trabas no puedes salir del combate hasta que no matas al enemigo.
Avanzas una casilla saqueas habitaciones de izquierda a derecha, te chetas de objetos,(TRANSMUTANDOLOS , una regla absurda) y cuando chocas con un monstruo te tiras 3 o cuatro turno con todos los jugadores tirando dados, hasta que el azar termine.

Campaña inexistente...

LO BUENO: componentes, minis bastante decentes. Ideal para jugar con niños de 5 añitos, no necesitas pensar solo avanzas y tiras dados....

Being in a dark space will not hide you from a baddies line of sight or tracking when it comes to enemy movement so it seems largely pointless.

Bought on Kickstarter. 
Rules clumsily written and hard to understand in places.
Doesn't scale well across number of players.
Upgrading heroes across quests makes no sense either - you can get Lvl4 items at the end of one dungeon and not be able to use them until right at the end of the next. 
Miniatures appear to be cast in a ""Soapy"" plastic and need careful prep for paint to stick. Not the most detailed at small sizes.

** Update **
Miniatures appear less ""Soapy"" after being ignored for a while. A decent wash will probably cure them. Played it with the 3 others from my gaming group and it was a lot more fun - which means the rules have a big problem scaling. I also think we have too much treasure and that this will unbalance very quickly. Still unsure about how good campaign mode is as after quest one we are mostly full with lvl 2 skills. Quest 1 was quite hard in places - a few unlucky draws and we were swamped. It's good that we can still feel jeopardy, but again Balance seems lacking"
340,garyh1964,8,"Not our usual type of game, but that's a good thing. It's a CMON game, and I would have to say that they are my favorite publisher of Ameri-trash games.

353,Ghool,10,"The kids will probably love this. Kickstarted with everything that wasn't duplicates in the campaign.
The list of add-ons is quite long...both hero and enemy boxes, the Z:BP exclusives, 2 sets of marbled dice, plastic tokens, elementals (yeah, despite the price), bridges and doors.

It's been a while since I've had the funds to back a big KS like this. I'm pretty excited to paint all those massive monsters. This can't come soon enough.
I also have never dove all-in on the Kickstarter since Rivet Wars (what a shame, too - great minis, awful game) like this one either.

At the very least this will make for a very fun painting project, and a good game to play with the kids. And yes, I am rating this before I even own it. This is based on the desire to play, and it will most-likely see a large amount of play in this house.

I took my time making the decision to back this, and it has been a very long while since I have heavily invested in any game, or a Kickstarter. My feelings are founded on what I have seen concerning the game play, and how this is the kind of dungeon crawler I have been looking for. So, yes, it's already a '10' based on that alone - I don't make decisions like this lightly when it concerns this large an amount of initial investment in the game. I suspect it won't disappoint.

Package received. Expectations on model quality are far exceeded. The models are incredible and worth the pledge price without the game attached.

Gameplay Observations:
This is exactly what I expected, and was looking for in a dungeon crawler. My wife and kids can tolerate the length, and the complexity, which means it's a winner.

It doesn't overstay its' welcome, and despite what others might say, I found it pretty balanced so far. Although we have played only with 4 characters, and to me it feels that's where this game was tested the most.

This is Diablo in a board game. Do not mistake it for anything else, and you won't be disappointed. It's fun. You kill lots of dudes, get lots of items, and get to min/max your character as you venture through each dungeon.

If you are looking for a good, and solid persistent campaign, look elsewhere. The Story Mode feels tacked on, and will require some house-ruling to get it to work right. I personally wasn't looking for a persistent campaign system, and this game works perfectly for a one-off in which you can build your character and get cool items to make them killing machines.

This is the D&D RPG experience boiled down to it's basic parts, and can be played in one to two hours. This is perfect for going from zero-to-hero in a single session.

Scenarios can also provide a better experience. Choose wisely when introducing the game to more seasoned gamers. Quests, 2, 5, and 9 stand out as particularly good, and they provide a greater challenge and more strategy than most of the other scenarios. Skip the tutorial, and Quest 1, and jump right into quest 2 if you can parse the rules - you will have a much better experience of what the game is able to provide.

Still holding at a 10, and the models are some of the nicest generic fantasy models around. A blast to paint, with very little clean up, and fills needed.

So far it's a thumbs up from my entire family. Myself, and the kids are itching to play every day."

357,Glic2003,4,"Feels like Baby's First Dungeon Crawler, right down to the brightly-coloured dice.   Utterly awful gameplay; tedious, dull and random - but never in an exciting way.  

Some of the large miniatures are impressive, making the KS version a good deal (retail version... not so much).  It's a shame they're wasted on such a poor game."
358,glmaximus,8.4,"This is my favorite non campaign dungeon crawl. It and Gloomhaven (my favorite campaign dungeon crawl) are the only fully co-op dungeon crawl games I think are done right.  The campaign mode of Massive Darkness is bad; however playing each level in the campaign (but starting with fresh heroes each time) is a ton of fun.  Progression is fast and meaningful within one game.  Combat is simple, but on your turn there are meaningful choices to make.  The minis are gorgeous.  Time in game is good if no one in your group is horrendously slow.

I was lucky enough to catch the Kickstarter- and having all the extra roaming monsters does add a lot of variety to the game.  However given that all monsters come out with random equipment on them, I'd give the base game at least an 8.

So you know where I sit with dungeon crawls for reference:
I like Descent, but would rather play DnD 5e than a 1 vs all dungeon crawl.  Super Dungeon explore's full co-op rules are not great.  Castle Ravenloft (and its ilk) are good games, but feels more like puzzles than a dungeon crawl."

363,Goodsound,7.5,"The rules could have been written more clearly. Much text, where a simple table or graphic was better. And I think the rules need some tweaking so this  game can really shine. Some problems: the amount of treasures (Door cards) does not scale with amount of players (monsters do).   In our first three player game we felt flooded with treasures. The AI of monsters;  you easily can avoid dealing with them by standing with your heroes out of line of sight in the shadow. Monsters will head down to the starting zone which is surely empty after two rounds. Until it comes back (exit zone) you're gone. AI should be smarter (predecessor Zombicide has better AI).
Also the monsters/mobs do not evolve like the heroes.  At start it seems difficult with starting gear, but as soon you have level 3 weapons you take down a mob in a single turn. Story mode is questionable:  your progress will be slower, saying that, the first quest will be really difficult, the second maybe mediocre, but surely starting the third one means that you will have already the best gear available so it starts being a cakewalk.  And what are your goals during the next quests?  Surely not as much play tested at it should have been. No thoughts about balancing, CMON?
What bothers me in terms of gameplay is that you as a hero deal only with two entities: either monsters or treasure. This can get stale soon. I wished there was more to interact with (Items that change a room from light to dark and vice versa (a torch)) or just using some kinda tools (f.i. a trap token for monsters, which lose health when stepping into) or furniture for barricades or similar. Or that rooms can have special traits (you heal there or lose something when staying there). Or shuffling a special mission based item into the treasure deck to be found etc.
Rule Tweaks:  
1) at least with fewer players don't get all the treasures in a zone  with a single action.
2) at level 1 or 2 monsters may go first to the starting zone, but starting with level 3 it should head first to the exit zone (and then come back).
3) last blow kill item held by monster falls down in zone where monster is is killed, no automatic ""teleport"" to hero with ranged attacks, it must me picked up.
4) more to come"

I have only played the tutorial with them and we were having a blast, although I had to houserule a bit because the 4 yr old wanted to play the monsters - easily done in this game, we also gave him a board.

If want a game with solid mechanics you want to play over n over this is far from. Sold it after around 10 plays in a month when saw the game was just bad even after lots of house rules. Buy Middara core if want a good dungeon crawler the sheer content and gameplay in the core is solid and is one of the best price for value in board games.
398,Horneater,6,"It seemed too easy for quite a while in a four player game. It felt difficult in level 3 of 4, when the Agent arrived. Then we felt overwhelmed, but quickly were able to get a handle on the situation as a mob really just means they have more HP, but not more fighting power. Then it was just a run to the end with not much opposition. I really like the leveling up system and the fact that if you have a tank that runs in and destroys baddies, other players can get experience.  Prefer Zombicide (Black Plague/Wulfsburg) for the gameplay. If CMON could mix the Zombicide gameplay with the leveling up system and experience sharing for big bads, that'd be pretty nice.

403,IJJusion,2,"Played 10+ times now, originally was amazing, but the game is too easy with zero tension building up as the game goes on unless you get super unlucky in the first few turns of the game - as theres no tension and choices are very obvious it makes the game fairly bland.

The amazing minis help make it more entertaining throughout, but then the game takes 3-4 hours to play (minimum unless you die early or you're playing a time limited scenario (there's about 2-3 of these in the book)

Combat is wayyy too convoluted for a simple dice system, can take 60 seconds+ to work out what you have rolled due to so many adjustments being made to the dice roll which again just draws out how long the game takes.

Overall, meh, wont say no to the game, but not interested in seeking out future games anymore.

UPDATE: Played again after a few months break - tried making my own custom scenario to boost the difficulty up a lot - still too easy in the end (the last boss had 160 HP which is 3x the highest you can otherwise get and had the abilities of 2 roaming monsters, still too easy) combat is super tedious once you get beyond level 3, will never play this again, not worth the time investment, the mini's are the only thing keeping this from a 1."

Drags on too long and gets tedious. Several players left the table to watch TV. 

It is not the length of the game that is the issue as we play other games that are long,  Zombicide takes around the same length of time but is far more fun. 

Not really any tension in the game, baddies turned up and were wiped out by the first player to come across them. Treasure was found but was all a bit same-y.

Any treasures we found were just cycled through to get the next level up. 

Leveling up characters was ok but I kept forgetting what each character could do, what their Bams did, what happened when they were in shadow mode, what their special skill was etc.

Miniatures all look very similar, nicely made though. Will use them for Zombicide.

Played about three times after the initial trial game.Probably won't hit the table again."

If you'r a beginner stop reading here and start playing!

From the perspective of a more experienced or veteran gamer it is severely lacking on story elements, complex decision making, Role Playing elements in general and has several other issues . It does not come close to the same level as games like Sword and Sorcery, Darklight etc because it's a very different casual experience designed for quick play but with  a problematic slapped on campaign mode. It should not be compared with those type of games although sometimes i can't help to to think this was a missed opportunity. Also a good game to proxy figures and bosses."

Breezy and easy to play and it is very satisfying how the characters go from zeros to powerhouses over the course of a scenario.  So far the scenarios have been well-designed (when played with 4 heroes) and have avoided the ""samey samey"" feeling that afflicted Zombicide: Black Plague.

Update: having played the full campaign, I think what I appreciated most was the incredible variety of antagonists on offer.  We never reshuffled the monster decks and even late in the campaign were still seeing new monsters for the first time."

508,KristopherHickman,6,"I got a kickstarter copy of this game after the pledge manager had closed. The number of miniatures in this game exceed anything else in my collection. They are quality, but all were lighter than I expected knowing other CMON games. Massive Darkness is a true Ameri-trash game in the same vein of Zombicide Black Plague. This time though, its not just zombies we have to worry about. Goblins, trolls, dwarves, reptile men and barbarians lurk behind every corner while terrifying monsters roam the halls and dungeons, looking for heroes to devour. It scales very well and works best as a one-shot game. If you are a completionist, beware! There is a lot to this game. Between the two, I'd say Black Plague is simpler, but harder. I also prefer BP to Massive Darkness but will gladly play either and the excessive amount of compatibility these two have with one another makes it so that both have a spot in my collection."
509,Krovikan,4,"Let's start off with the good, quality of models are outstanding, the first level of the game is challenging. Alright, the bad, outside of the art there is a clear lack of attention to detail, Lil'Neds base is too large so you can't fit the player rings around it. Monster cards don't have model numbers on them. Cards from the factory have quality issues (they are replacing those affected), and frankly, for a game called Massive Darkness, the game is too easy, Lil'Ned as a Battle Wizard is an example of an extremely broken combo that even at level 2 can demolish most Greater Monsters with little difficulty. The game itself hasn't been thought through to give a challenging and rewarding experience.

Yes there is a story mode with slower progress and yes, if you only want a short game you might want to level up as you fight. But it just seems illogical.

I like the large square map, I also wanted to use something like this for one of my game. I think it's one of the key elements that makes the AI possible. Having those cards spawn stuff in the room is also interesting. On the other hand, the dungeons seems very simplistic and there is no interest in exploring and discovering the layout.

The shadow mechanism is very interesting, it gives some sort of  tactical positioning which can increase the strategy of the game."

It felt more like I'm constantly wondering if this weapon is good or that weapon is better. I was also constantly exchanging weapons, checking abilities. Finally, the general feeling was very repetitive. 

However, I liked the game pieces so much that I just kept trying to find ways to make it work. I finally created a house rule version that I find fun.

It takes the basic elements of a dungeon crawl - opening rooms, killing monsters, looting - and wraps it round the core of Zombicide rules - so you level up quite rapidly - this means that by the time you hit level 3 your heroes are quite hardcore and can kill pretty much anything. There is therefore little challenge in story-mode and as a result the game has all the depth of a puddle. That's why I bought DMM, as I wanted a more gritty dungeon crawl. I will probably sell this once the minis are painted."

561,LX1986,8,"I played a lot of dungeon crawlers, but I like this one the best. 

I really enjoy playing this game. it feels like a pure dungeon crawler. you are actually crawling through dark dungeons while slaying hordes of enemies. awesome.

there are so many variations of this genre on the market, but none really hit the spot for me. most of the ""one vs many""-versions feel very imbalanced, which is highly frustrating. also someone has to play the evil guy all alone, while his friends team up against him, which is certainly not for everyone. most co-op-versions are extremely dull and get boring very fast. others try to emulate a pen and paper RPG. either they fail miserably in that attempt or the game becomes way too complex for what it actually has to offer at its core. 

bottom line for me personally is, that dungeon crawlers are inherently a simple genre. it allows adults to play with little toys, which is fine (I do it myself). therefore it has to be fun and entertaining foremost, like a good super hero movie. and Massive Darkness does this perfectly in my opinion. if I want a complex strategy game, I will play an area control game like twilight imperium or something else like blood rage. If I want to engage into an immersive and vast world, I will play a pen and paper RPG. Massive Darkness offers you a fast-paced action adventure, which will most likely appeal to many gamers and non-gamers out there."
562,Lyannah,4,"Someone needed to reign in the designers, there's too many card decks/tokens/identical minis etc. The ""mob"" enemies don't need to be an actual mob, they basically serve as armor anyway. 

Combat is dice rolls, which would be fine if they balanced dice rolls with some form of RvR, but they didn't. The idea of adding item card stats to enemies is nice, I'll give them that  - but even then, armor cards on enemies is rough at low levels.

Strategy is almost non-existent (think Zombicide). Setup/packup is horrendous because the devs couldn't control themselves.

Game length for the larger quests is 4+ hours, which again, would be fine if there was some strategy and interesting combat.

I don't think I've regretted a KS more than this one, and I backed Dark Souls."

571,Malaki242,8,"Some house rule changes to increase the overall difficulty but a great game. I am glad that I purchased all the additional content to increase the enemies, heroes and roaming monsters as it adds much more options to the game. Only major negative so far is how CMON skimped on their customers with low quality boxes for the KS items and some add-ons. It will be extremely difficult to store/organize and setup/breakdown games even with after market box inserts additional ""side boxes"" will be needed to try and address this. They should have made a real box for Light Bringer pledges or followed suit with Sword & Sorcery's concept of a special box for KS backers that holds all the extras. 

Easy way to make more challenging without taking away from the game or adding a bunch of rules is to nerf the treasures. Either reduce the amount for door cards or treat the treasure tokens as currency and if you want a level 3 treasure you have to trade in 3 treasure tokens to get it. "

Needed to build an insert as sleeved cards and the tokens won’t fit inside the box (what thoughts had CMON where to put the punched out tokens?)
even with insert and organized cards long set up time (15min)
box for monsters: roaming monsters can fall down if not withdrawn on table

best part is character progression and how you equip them
(with 2 or 3 players you will be flooded with equipment; so we canceled transmute during quest and shifted it to townphase)
with dice roll and depending on treasure boss/agent/roaming monster gets equipped with game gets deadly very fast
if the equipment can’t be used by the enemy it usually stays easy

The heroes get too powerful at about level 4 skills so that even roaming monsters get killed before counter attack or activation. With giving them more health (approved test with player count + level instead of only player count) it gets better as the heroes have to watch out. With Quests at Level 5 usually the heroes and the enemies have 3Y3R attack. So very luck dependent if you don't have acquired good defense skills as well. 

Over all as I expected 20% for the gameplay (fun easy rolling dice with some strategy/tactical elements on some of the quests)  and 80% to have (great) miniatures to paint and be used with pathfinder.

EDIT from 5 to 6.5 after playing some one-shots with 3 heros; game is far better in this mode than story mode. More tense and harder (especially with KS roaming monsters) and more thinking needed what actions to do with your heros (at least till level 3)."

Great component quality and art. 

A pretty simple, but fun, dungeon romp. You get a lot of exp and treasure making it entertaining to kick back with friends and spend an evening slaying your way through a dungeon.  

I think this is a notch above Zombicide Black Plague, which I also enjoy playing. The class/profession combos when combined with the dungeon levels and loot make character progression more meaningful. 

Scaling encounters are great. You can play the game with one to six players with each player only controlling 1 character. This is a huge improvement when compared to Zombicide games which require players to control multiple characters if you don't have max player count. 

Bad: 
There is a lot of randomness to this game making it extremely unbalanced. At times it is too easy and other times the party just gets crushed. The difficulty is dependent on the draw of the monster, draw of the items, draw of the event, dice rolls, etc. without many options to even out the luck both for or against the players. 

Blue/green dice and symbols weren't very colorblind friendly for one of our players. 

You will want to get the extras, there isn't enough creature or character variety to keep things fresh over an extended period of time."

Though the wording in the rules seemed to confuse the group I played with on a few different occasions. So it's hard to give it a full review here is the thing that the group noticed:

Being level 1 was brutal. My character died immediately, and our poor wizard had the same (on different turns), which meant we lost our only 2 lives and if any of us died again we would immediately lose the mission. After all of us got some equipment, and got to level 2 abilities we were in the clear and the game was pretty much a cake walk. (need to try other missions).

Personally, I tried the campaign once but it seems like more trouble that it is worth. There is no good saving mechanism built in, so it's gonna require extra work to make sure your character have everything in subsequent play sessions, I haven't read the rules fully for this section, but I don't imagine the scaling difficulty is very good here either.

I miss read the rules so often, I can't tell if I'm just a idiot or the rules were worded in a way that were meant to be misinterpreted.

Despite all this I enjoyed the first mission I played with my group and look forward to trying out the other missions."

639,mulltalica,8,"Great dungeon crawler that hits all the cravings of a miniatures game without the overly long and complicated ruleset. The basics of the game are exactly what they appear: go through a dungeon, kill the mobs, get loot, power up. The characters and the classes allow for some interesting mixing and matching. Rounds flow pretty smoothly, with very minimal interruptions or moments of confusion in regards to who is doing what. The AI system for the enemies can be a bit easy to game, but I personally would rather a have an easier AI to understand/explain to newer players than an overly complex one. 

The only downfall in the game seems to come from the power curve. Starting the game in Level 1, things can be a little hard and you really have to rely on teamwork and strategy to take out mobs and roaming monsters. However, once your team hits level 3 and you start unlocking your skills and finding equipment that maxes out your dice rolls, it becomes a bit too easy. Late game combat also becomes a bit of a chore as there isn't really a good way to track all of the equipment and skill cumulative bonuses. 

As is, the game is great for casual board gamers who would thrill of taking a lowly adventurer and turning them into a force of nature. For those who are seeking a more challenging game that requires grinding and careful strategy, don't fret. With some very minor house rules you can easily make this game what you crave. What's more, the game is ripe for owners to create custom scenarios. All of this combines for a product that I highly recommend for players of all types."

The best thing is  I can play it alone or with a group.  

When compared to zombicide Black Plague it’s a bit more complicated. If a group is new to dungeon crawlers I’ll go for zombicide other wise I will always prefer this over zombicide. 

Play time is lengthy so around 3-4 hours long per quest.

653,Neengash,6,"My first impression of it (playing the tutorial, solo) was horrible. It felt like a really easy game with no real need of thinking, since the character was so overpowered, that simply rolling the dice would kill all enemies.

And then I tried playing it 2 and 4 heroes. The 2 heroes trial, gave me the same feel of something missing. But, then we tried the 4 heroes one, enemies suddently felt stronger (simply because there were more of them, or they had more health) decisions had to be made to keep the group alive (we died two times, once more and it would have been over) and after a 4 long hours of game, i got to enjoy it a lot.

So right now, pending the story mode version in which you continue with your character development from one scenario to the next one, my feeling of the game is ""That's a good Dungeon crawler game i would not have any  problem playing it again"".

Glad i took this 4 heroes game. Nevertheless, i think i won't be playing a 1 or 2 heroes game anymore D:"

One is that there are now dice for attack and defense, which I'm not really a fan of. It isn't as obnoxious as in, say, Descent, but it's there. On the flip side, I like that you can transmute items into something new so that you aren't just carrying around a bunch of junk. I also like how this scales better than Zombicide, and the class system is interesting. The campaign feels pretty tacked-on, but it's there.

So how does this stack up to Zombicide for me - specifically, Black Plague? Well, I like Black Plague better, though I recognize that this is the next evolution of the system. I just prefer the simplicity of  Zombicide's design, and you could easily add in most of the campaign rules and transmute action if you wanted to. Massive Darkness does have the light and dark mechanic, which I really like, but if I'm going to invest in one, Black Plague is what I prefer. I just don't like that you must use 6 characters in BP, but otherwise I enjoy it more."

689,Panzerdude,2,"After the tutorial, our group thought the game had potential.  After the first scenario (6 hours later), not so much.

The first 2 levels were pretty fun, challenging and tense.  Once our heroes got to level 3, there wasn't a tense moment the rest of the game.  You kill monsters and they don't threaten you.  You keep leveling up and it only gets worse.  We had 6 heroes; if we had 3 they would have transmuted treasure way too quickly and become OP even sooner.

Yes, it took 6 hours to move through the hordes, but no fun was happening.  As we neared the end, we realized there is a huge piece missing...there is no boss, or end of scenario challenge.  The ""end"" is just like the rest of the scenario, except that you ""exit"" the map.  It's over.

The time commitment is not worth the experience.  There are too many other dungeon crawls with better everything (the ""darkness"" mechanic is not that special).

We thought of a host of ways the game could be better:

- Agents move away from group, instead of toward.
- Leveling of guards and agents needs to increase greatly.
- Too many treasures are either OP or useless.  Not scaled  well.
- Way too many treasure tiles.
- There should be a ""timing"" mechanic that forces you to move through the dungeon.
- There should be penalties allowing too many monsters to accumulate.
- Transmuting and other abilities should cost an action point.

We thought about making some house rules.  The problem is nothing is scaled well.  Where would we start?  Games are so long that play-testing every aspect of the game would take a huge time commitment.  No thanks.  The designer should have done that.

After the game, I packed it up and said, ""Ebay.""  Everyone agreed."

UPDATE: A third game confirmed what I've read here.

Less, but more challenging, monsters and less equipment, might put the game back ""on tracks""...

725,ratimir,N/A,"KS. Very disappointing gameplay, even measured against fairly modest expectations. Only keeping it for the minis, and to use the tiles in Zombicide. I don't expect to ever play the game itself again.

BAD
- The game drags way too slowly for something so lightweight.
- The campaign rules are a tacked-on afterthought.
- The system of rolling two different types of special symbols to spend on activating various character skills (scattered across your character card, your equipment cards and your class sheet) is unnecessarily fiddly without actually achieving anything interesting.
- Enemy mobs are basically just hit point counters for their boss. All those cool minis doing practically nothing.
- Difficulty. Surviving your first fight is a coin toss. Once you've got some loot and XP, level 1-2 still offers some challenge. After that, it all goes downhill. Beating big bads at level five is either a superpowered combo one-shot or a dull grind of wearing away their hit points while nothing interesting happens, depending on your characters and equipment.
- Equipment. Transmutation combining 3 low-level items into 1 higher-level is just weird for non-magical characters. It could work fine in a more abstracted game, but not here.
- Ludonarrative dissonance: We're the Lightbringers, battling against the minions of The Darkness. We're surface dwellers intruding into the lairs of creatures who live their lives in darkness. So shouldn't the dark areas be more beneficial to them than to us?

GOOD
- Excellent component quality, artwork, etc.
- Monsters will actually use the loot that you later take off their corpse.
- Enemy ""AI"" is simple but works smoothly.
- Stealth rules, something many better dungeoncrawlers lack."

769,Sam and Max,3,"[q=""zinho73""]It seems like a game that stopped development when it was good enough.[/q]

Yeah. It stopped development in 1989 when HeroQuest was made! :laugh:

The ""shields and swords"" mechanic's been used since HeroQuest, in games like HeroQuest, Battle Masters, HeroScape, Magic: The Arena, etc. FFG introduced the ""surge"" mechanic with Descent back in 2009. These aren't necessarily the first use of these mechanics, but should give an idea of how *old* they are. Dungeoncrawling, Levels, XP, etc. can be traced back to *1977* with Dungeons and Dragons. 

Shadow mode, mobs, transmutation, and roaming monsters *are* uncommon mechanics, but they sorta fell flat in the final rules. I think the consensus is that after the KS ended, shadow mode and mobs were further developed to be more streamlined, but not more interesting play. Roaming monsters made the game worse, by introducing random swinginess. Transmutation makes the game too easy once players start acquiring treasure. 

What HeroQuest et al. didn't have was bookkeeping, and MD fell into the trap of adding complexity without adding gameplay. Heck, HQ had *spell cards* which MD and Descent don't. I've also yet to find the ""diminishing returns"" search mechanic HQ uses (you draw from a deck, removing the treasures from it, but returning to it the traps!). It really is too bad that HQ isn't on the market, because it's a far less bookeeping game than MD is, yet just as much fun (or more!). HQ pretty much blows away MD for the kids and casuals.

I finally played Myth yesterday, and *wow* its card focus brings a lot to the dungeoncrawl genre. It's ridiculously complicated, but I highly recommend it for dungeoncrawl gamers who don't mind a game that evolved in left field."

781,scurvy duck,4,"Massive Darkness is an underwhelming game due to the built in randomness, the rules and figure statistics. A great dungeon crawl has a well balanced story with plot twists. Since the game was a kickstarter, there are add-ons and exclusive figures. A set of stories could not be written that is made for the add-ons since many would find that extra expense prohibitive. The story could not be written just for the core game since that would exclude the add-ons and few would buy them.  For those buying the game at retail, the stories can't have KS exclusive figures. So CMON made a game that randomly introduces figures, some of which in a well written story would be reserved for climactic conclusions.
The rules have some unnecessary complications. To gradually challenge to players, there are levels on the playing surface which are truly confusing. That aspect activates enemy figures from 5 levels of difficulty. The difference between each level is so minimal as to make it pointless. The hero players level up so much each game that they are un-phased by the most threatening foe.
The worst aspect of Massive Darkness is the statistics for the monsters and heroes. The monster stats have no relation to the size and threat of each figure. There are too many small figures with better dice combinations than the largest and scariest figures. The problem with the hero statistics is that they have none. A wizard can out barbarian a barbarian with the acquisition of heavy arms and armor.
The good part of Massive Darkness are the monster figures. The large ones are well detailed and look awesome. Yet the best ones are KS exclusives, so buying the retail game would feel like an insult. The small ones are above average but not much to excited about. The artists seem to have taken some shortcuts with too many monsters wearing skirts. I'd mention the lack of a dragon but that is another story."

790,sgbeal,3,"KS all-in (except for Z:BP bits, as i don't have Z:BP). i'd give it an 8 or 9 if it moved as smoothly as classic Zombicide (as opposed to Black Plague, with which i have no experience). As it is, mid- to late game (levels 3+), 50-75% of the play time is spent checking for skill effects from the class skill sheets, and this time increases as the levels progress to 4 and 5. Balance/difficulty is very swingy, depending largely on how many Roaming Monsters the Event Deck throws at you in levels 1-2. After level 3, the only challenge the game can really throw at you is an aggressive scenario-specific timer.

"
817,soccastar001,8,"This is a fantasy adventure game with lots of miniatures.  Pretty much Descent but with programming-controlled enemies instead of the need for an overlord.

You set up a scenario using the tiles and rules described in the book for the chosen quest.  Then players select a hero and a hero class.  Each hero has a recommended class but you can mix and match to your heart's content which is nice for variability.  On a player's turn they take two actions which can be anything from moving to attacking to transmuting items into higher quality items.  The main ways that enemies make it into the games (besides being a part of setup) is through door cards or event cards.  Door cards are drawn whenever a closed door is opened and place treasure and enemies on the board.  Events are drawn each round and can be good or bad and are usually the method the hardest enemies (roaming monsters) make it into the game.

First of all, the game looks amazing, at least in terms of miniatures.  I'm not the biggest fan of the art.  And for what I paid on Kickstarter the amount that I got is completely worth it.  The rulebook seemed well-written as well which lately seems to be a rarity unfortunately.

Of course I would expect the rulebook to not be such an issue because the game is reasonably simple.  There're very few unique powers or abilities so most of the game consists of moving around and rolling different amounts of dice for combat.  And this game really does seem to be all about the combat.  Which is nice because sometimes that's what you're after and sets it apart a little bit from other fantasy adventure games that might focus more on narrative, puzzles, and tactics.  Not that that isn't here, just with a larger side of bashing bad guys.

The biggest criticism I've seen is that this game is too easy.  I didn't feel that way, granted I only played the tutorial quest (which was super simple) and the spider quest but that one we won on the very last possible turn before defeat.  And it was a hard-earned win.  I will say I think the campaign rules seem kind of pointless.  They just slow down progression so that you level up slowly over time but start from a higher starting point in subsequent adventures.  I wouldn't bother but that's just fine because nowadays I don't really have time to play campaigns, I'd rather have a one session adventure.

I think my own major piece of criticism is that the game is very simple and when it comes to fantasy adventure games with character classes and abilities and powers and a varied stack of weapon cards and different enemies I want a little complication.  I like lots of rules and variability.  But as of yet I haven't been disappointed with what is here."

If you do buy the game, remember that it is not built to be a well thought out ""Gloomhaven"" rich campaign. It is however, a dungeon crawl that you can slay lots of monsters, get fun loot, and feel like a powerful adventurer at the end of your 1-2+ hours of play. I'm planning to post a more in depth review, but for now I'm gonna keep playing :)"

847,sykano,5,"simplified dungeon crawler game with nice miniatures

+ has some nice ideas (shadow mode, simplified battle system with custom dice, monsters modified by equipment, modular board, fast level up, ...)
+ quality miniatures
- a bit oversimplified in some parts, could be made better
- game balance issues: characters seem unbalanced, items quite weak, big monsters a bit too strong
- doesn't play that well ?
-- extremely expensive

I played it once so far, it didn't play that well, maybe we played some things wrong, I don't know. We had one character way overpowered (Sibyl?) and the others not able to do much against bigger/tougher monsters. My character still had mostly its starting equipment through to the end of the quest. We had two Noble Warriors giving action points to the one stronger character to do all the work, and frankly we wouldn't have made it without that. -> Not a good game experience!

I don't like the rolling attack and defense dice at once.
Strict turn order seems hindering.

I think dungeon crawlers are in general better as computer games."

Capture the essence of Diablo 2 dungeon crawling hack and slash game. Love it. Always hoped to have a board game like this. So much dungeon crawling game fail at delivering a tense and satisfying gameplay. 

House rule added : Heroes can move out of enemies zone, but suffer one attack from the monsters in that zone with no possibility to retaliate for that action.

Having to add house rules to a game cost the game losts of points.

For those winning that game is too easy add this HOUSE RULE :
EVERY MONSTER IN MOBS ATTACK ON ITS OWN, WITHOUT THE ITEM CARRIED BY THE BOSS (boss still attack also)

Also, lots of monsters in tha box is good, but is turn out bad if half those monsters are similar ( ex : archer goblin & warrrior goblin, 2 type of dwarf mob, 2 type of orc mobs)
Could have been a much better game and convenient box if they would have spare the expansions and include ratlings and reptisaurians already in tha box instead of too much goblin/orc/dwarf

I love CMON, but I hate how these important design details were not implemented."
882,tinyclanger,3,"Really not impressed with this game. It suffers in comparison to Zombicide Black Plague, in that it increases the complexity and ""unthematic"" gaminess without adding much tactical depth. 

There aren't many interesting decisions to be made, most of the abilities on levelling up are just +1 to defence, attack etc. Many of the rules (e.g which player a monster attacks, or the handling of mobs of enemies) seem completely at odds with the theme, so it ends up feeling much less intuitive than Zombicide. Hopefully someone will come up with some rules to turn this top quality box of toys into a game. Otherwise it's simply awful.

As always with semen/cmon kickstarter games; it's not worth buying the retail edition (unless heavily discounted), it's really bad value compared to the kickstarter."

887,tommischief,7,"Quite a nice dungeon crawler, but (like many CMON games I hear) with a lot more potential than actual substance. Utterly amazing minis, beautiful art, great quality. Gameplay ... alright. Not the level of Gloomhaven or ... Mage Knight, nor even Dungeon Alliance, but nice. Much simpler.
Kick open a door, roll 20 dice, kill 5 enemies. The remaining 15 enemies roll 21 dice to which you roll your 35 defense and they do 1 damage to you. Lather, rinse, repeat. Good as a light-hearted, simple, filler dungeon crawl.
Honestly - an avid minis painter or a DnD DM may get a lot more mileage from this game. (And get a bit of cardboard to burn in a stove or something.) Sold it away because I have several better dungeon crawlers and this one did not seem to see the table...ever."

899,Tunguska,7.5,"Initial thoughts after tutorial and one mission, core box only, normal mode, 2 players.

An incredibly entertaining, if entirely brainless, dice chucker. Strongly reminds me of the hack and slash loot-fest of the Diablo video games. There are even armour sets!

Plenty of flaws. There is almost no story. It has a weird difficulty curve which starts out quite tough and very quickly becomes easy to the point of trivial. It's long (ish) and has a fair bit of book keeping which could get stodgy with more players. With 2 players, a full mission took a good couple of hours. Could see this getting quicker with experience but still a bit long for how light it is.

Despite all that, it really is great fun.  I never got bored of charging into mobs of goblins with my barbarian, cleaving through the minions before (literally) headbutting the boss to death. The characters and classes feel fun and varied. Your heroes quickly turn into wrecking balls, dripping in fancy loot. While it makes the difficulty pretty laughable, it's still hilarious fun and it'd be easy to house rule to make things more challenging.

I had a blast and can't wait to play again, encounter new monsters, try new characters. 

If a challenging and cerebral coop experience is what you're after, this is probably not for you. If you feel like spectacularly splatterating a shit load of goblins and then stealing their fancy trousers, this is the game!

Lastly, couldn't talk about a CMON game without mentioning components which are superb. Miniatures are very good quality, sculpts and art style are characterful and a little cartoony (which fits the game perfectly). You get a generous amount of stuff, even with just the core box. Great value for any miniature painters and I will certainly be making a lot of use of them in our D&D campaigns.

Edit: After some more plays, I do think the play time is an issue. The larger maps take a very long time to play. Could make it difficult to get to the table. Fun factor is still high for me. Knocking half a point off my score due to excessive game length."

Ketten is szuper, nagyon jól működött a dolog. Egy hosszabb, de nagyon jópofa küldetést próbáltunk, ahol nem legyakni kellett a szörnyeket, hanem hálóval befogni őket. Két törpe harcosunk sikeresen megoldotta a feladatot és megint nagyon jól szórakoztunk.

Újabb pár kétfős játék után emelek a pontszámon, ez egy nagyon szórakoztató játék változatos karakterekkel."

984,_aur3lius,7,"It is _not_ Zombicide! And that's fine. I was really hopeful for this concept. I think it falls a bit short. For as much as a single turn turn can swing a game of Z:BP this game feels even worse. Specifically, in certain scenarios if you don't get decent loot in the beginning it can be difficult to move forward without expending all of your lives. 

ORRRRR you become god-like and there's no challenge.

*Update 8/2018*: The above is still true, but after playing this a lot more I've found the game holds more weight than Zcide. The inclusion of the Light/Dark zone adds significantly more depth to the game as you can hide from mobs and monsters in order to position yourself for an epic attack. 

I still prefer Zcide, as it is just good Ameritrash fun, but MD has claimed a spot on my shelf and will stay for a while."
