3,agentpatman,7,"A lot lighter than we expected. Families with young teens or earlier would probably enjoy this. Nothing particularly bad it's just pretty light on strategy. Place gear, collect resource, repeat. Became a little more interesting when you can draft your gear instead of drawing. Sometimes you get lucky blocking an action which you could disguise as strategy. Great miniatures, but for us it's just little light on the decision making and doesn't provide enough fun in return like some other games."

9,ande9249,8,"Yes it is lighter, But the player powers does give just enough unbalancing to the game mechanics where each game does feel interesting. That said, most times you won't be able to leverage the player powers until around 25 min into the game. Which can be a lot to ask in a 60 minute game. "
10,Andr0ss,9,Based on my experience on playing the prototype alone I can say that this is an impeccable design. A great publisher will only curate this and flush out the graphics and component's but the design is solid and fantastic. I can't wait till its out on shelves. 161011
11,Andy Parsons,3,"Mixed production standards.  The building miniatures are nice and the plastic chips that are the players' workers have a good heft, though the bolt/copper plate chits are tiny.  The artwork is handsome and the rules are clear enough.  

Something appears to be missing, however.  An evil mastermind has stolen the excellent design that the combined talents of Lang and Bauza surely produced and replaced it with a simplistic exercise in worker placement and vp trawling."

Notre beau gros jeu de l’été dernier, il aura voyagé avec nous durant plusieurs semaines. En voiture et non en machine volante. Ceci dit on aura croisé une tarentule géante lors de nos balades. Et oh surprise, aucun article sur Trictrac, presque aucun avis…on pensait que c’était fait de longue date ! Allez on va se faire un plaisir de vous présenter ce bien beau jeu avec moults photos, on était en totale immersion victorienne durant l’été. Et autant le dire de suite, une fois le jeu sur la table, ça se joue en 35 minutes à 3 joueurs scoring inclus. 
Donc c’est beau ? Oui. Ambiance machines à vapeur d’un futur alternatif. Un thème clivant, souvent réservé à des jeux de niche pour spécialistes genre Dystopian Wars. Sauf que là c’est à destination des familles un peu joueuses et pas forcément aux joueurs velus. Ciblage pas forcément clair mais parti pris courageux. On se plaît à s’intéresser à cet univers décalé avec 6 beaux plateaux de machines bien détaillés aux salles farfelues, ces nombreuses figurines dont certaines nous parlent forcément, les méchants qui séquestrent des scientifiques…bref on est entrés dedans et ça nous a vraiment plu. Est-ce parce que notre néo-collégien lit « le château des étoiles » et qu’on a lu tous les Jules Verne étant jeunes ? 
Peut-être. Même quelques joueuses qui tiquaient en voyant la boîte ont finalement trouvé que oui, c’est plaisant et tellement gratifiant de jouer un jeu somme toute assez simple avec tout ce matériel qui fera pâlir certains projets KS au vu du rapport qualité prix ici imbattable (32 figurines dont 20 de belle taille au rendu mat superbe même sans peinture, honte à nous qui ne savons manier décemment le pinceau), un thermoformage façon organizer parfois coûteux…on se dit que les minuscules jetons fer/cuivre ne rentraient plus dans le budget, seul reproche côté matériel (remplacés chez nous par des kubenbois, voir photo).
Bref c’est aussi pour son univers graphique et son matériel qu’on apprécie jouer à ce jeu qui est somme toute « familial avancé » et non expert, si la science-fiction n’est pas votre truc du tout la présence visuelle imposante de ce jeu à table risque de ne pas trop plaire. 

Bon, visuellement c’est top, mais comment on joue ?
Tout simplement en posant des engrenages (= des ouvriers spécialisés). 
La moitié du temps de jeu est une succession de placements de ces engrenages-personnages sur l’une des villes disponibles, à tour de rôle. Face cachée évidemment. 
La pose du 3ème personnage sur une même ville déclenche une résolution et histoire de ne pas perdre le fil du tour, le joueur ayant déclenché cette résolution prend un pense bête devant lui, le « monocle de l’oubli ». Bien utile c’est vrai. 
La résolution des actions c’est donc la seconde moitié du temps de jeu à peu de choses près. 
Dans un premier temps, chaque disque offrira à son possesseur le butin de la ville concernée. Si les autres joueurs vous laissent placer 3 disques sur la même ville, ce qui arrive parfois, et bien vous rafflez 3 fois la récompense. 
Voici les butins disponibles : 
Londres : 1 jeton cuivre (pour faire sa machine)
Moscou : 1 en plus sur l’échelle de puissance de feu (histoire de pouvoir capturer des bâtiments)
Paris : 1 scientifique (utiles seuls ou par lots pour jouer un tour de plus ou chiper un bâtiment)
Rome : 1 codex (échelle de bonification additionnelle + possibilité de choisir le disque qu’on pose dès qu’on détient 5 codex plutôt que de jouer le coup suivant. Bien pratique donc)
Washington : 1 jeton fer (pour faire sa machine)

Ensuite on retourne la pile de 3 disques et on applique les effets des agents dans l’ordre. 

Voici enfin les capacités des agents : 
Le saboteur annule le jeton suivant (sauf de sa propre couleur). Rageant parfois, aléatoire souvent, le jeu en devient familial, même un bon tacticien ne pourra rien contre plusieurs saboteurs. 
On rappelle toutefois que tous les agents même annulés récupèrent quand même le butin de la ville.
L’acolyte récupère une seconde fois le butin de la ville. 
L’homme de main tente d’accomplir la mission actuellement présente dans cette ville. Il prend la carte si le pré-requis est validé et on ne remet pas de carte avant la fin du tour.  
L’artilleuse récupère un bâtiment à condition que votre puissance de feu soit suffisante (égale ou supérieuse à ce qu’indique la flèche). 
L’ingénieur déclenche le pouvoir de votre machine maléfique. 

Les machines justement, c’est un peu le petit côté asymétrique léger du jeu : les six proposées dans le jeu sont différentes visuellement et assez loufoques mais diffèrent surtout par le pouvoir apporté sur action de l’ingénieur. Elles orientent également certains choix lors de la partie : on aura davantage de cartes missions validées avec l’une, des ressources rapides avec une autre, des actions multiples avec une troisième…
On conseille un sachet zip par machine histoire d’éviter le bazar dans la boîte.
Un pouvoir de base est disponible pour chaque machine dès le début du jeu et 2 autres peuvent se débloquer en construisant les pièces adaptées. 
Construire un segment de machine c’est tout simple : une fois le bon nombre de jetons fer et cuivre posés sur cette section hop vous récupérez la tuile adaptée et défaussez les ressources. Chaque segment aura son utilité : puissance de feu augmentée, ressources récupérées, davantage de scientifiques stockables sur son plateau, PV supplémentaires à la fin…
Petite parenthèse : on a vite été dérangés par la minuscule taille des jetons fer/cuivre recto/verso. On préfère utiliser sur ce coup-là de bons vieux cubes, pas d’erreur en les manipulant. Gris, doré, posé terminé. 
En résumé, les machines se construisent grâce à 2 ressources de base. Le jeu se termine quand une machine est terminée (on fait alors un dernier tour et on résout tout ce qui traîne sur les villes). 
2 ressources seulement ? Oui, simple et efficace, on rappelle que cela reste selon nous un jeu familial. 
Les ressources s’obtiennent soit par le butin de 2 villes, soit par la capture de certains bâtiments (mais cela fait monter le niveau des services secrets), soit par le pouvoir de certaines machines. 

Trois dernière petites choses : 
1/ selon le bâtiment capturé (par l’homme de main par exemple ou par un trio de scientifiques), un bonus est récupéré. C’est l’une des façons d’obtenir 1 ressource + 2PV en fin de partie car chaque bâtiment vaudra 2 PV. Les monuments capitales offrent un jeton 2PV et aucune ressource.
2/ Les scientifiques permettent de rejouer un disque défaussé, de jouer un tour supplémentaire ou de capturer un bâtiment selon qu’on en défausse 1, 2 ou 3.
3/ Les missions disponibles influent sur le choix de jouer certains agents ou de capturer divers monuments. 
En fin de partie, le scoring prend en compte 5 domaines :  les PV des segments construits sur la machine, les codex, les missions, les jetons PV et les bâtiments. 
Le jeu se joue souvent à peu de choses, deux missions ou quelques codex de plus…Il y a beaucoup d’interactions « indirectes » via le plateau, on ne se vole rien et on ne se combat pas. Un peu trop gentils ces méchants donc, pas de crispation à table d’ailleurs sauf quand on se fera saboter pour la troisième fois de suite. Alors vous l’aurez deviné on aime beaucoup y jouer malgré quelques déconvenues au départ avec les règles, le jeu est flatteur et offre pas mal de choix simples. Ceci dit son positionnement n’est pas évident (très peu de retours d’ailleurs) car très typé par son thème et trop léger pour des joueurs chevronnés. Par contre en famille avec des ados, ça glisse tout seul et on laisse aisément le matériel sur la table dédiée plusieurs jours de suite car la mise en place et le rangement prennent un peu de temps malgré la boîte bien pensée. 
4 choses à bien prendre en compte : 
1/ La machine GRIFFE est trop puissante si on utilise ce qui est imprimé sur le plateau de cette machine. Il faut utiliser ce qui est écrit dans la règle (1.0 ou 1.1) à savoir qu’en activant la machine (via l’ingénieur), un joueur place immédiatement son prochain agent sous un agent du plateau central qui se trouve SEUL dans une ville. On ne déclenche donc pas de résolution en cascade en glissant sans arrêt un agent sous des piles de 2 agents comme nous l’avons joué un bon moment….
2/ L’utilisation de 3 scientifiques vous permet de capturer un bâtiment (si vous être ok au niveau puissance de feu). Vous gagnez alors le bonus lié à CE bâtiment spécifique et non pas le butin de la ville dont il provient. 
3/ Partout on figure un jeton PV (tête de mort + une valeur) il faut uniquement regarder la valeur indiquée. La tête de mort ne vaut pas 2 PV elle-même…quand une carte indique 3, c’est donc 3 PV et non pas 6 qu’on récupère (doute levé durant l’été dernier). Tous les petits jetons PV valent 2. 
4/ Quand on réussit une mission on récupère uniquement la carte mission de la ville, mais pas de jeton PV. La valeur indiquée sur la carte se suffira à elle-même en fin de partie lors du décompte.
Pour nous c’est entre 8 et 9 selon les critères BGG, on aime et on le recommande, on a été bavards sur ce coup ! Et petit clin d’œil pour finir à une BD de ce genre un peu particulier mais bien sympathique !"

17,bobpazjr,7,"This one brings some cool mechanisms together. Very enjoyable for the whole family. Kiddos definitely love it (age 7-12), and we've had some great fun introducing it to friends. There are a couple thematic/backstory holes I'd love to see filled, but I can't complain. This one's been a winner for us!"
18,Bond8089,5,"This is a strange production.  The game feels WAY overproduced, with all of the building miniatures seeming completely irrelevant.  They are cool... don't get me wrong, but they feel way out of place.  The artwork is also cool, but there is zero theme to this game... its all just a standard euro with some pretty art.  The game was fun to play, and I wouldn't mind playing again, but its not something I would ask to play."
19,brettspieletreff,1,"Die Gebäude stinken selbst nach Wochen noch. Das doppelseitig bedruckte Hauptspielmaterial (Chips) ist viel zu klein, die Gebäude sind zwar groß, werden aber nur einmal im Spiel gebraucht, wenn sie gestohlen werden und stehen sonst nur rum."
20,brewsaki,6,"Interesting but unexciting game. Overproduced for what it is. I mean, the buildings are basically 2-point tokens. There is 25 of them, 7 different models, all plastic... seriously? I kind of like the stacking of the chips but I feel like resolving the actions later breaks the flow of the game."
21,Briancph,7.5,"+ Turns are quick and simple
+ Gameplay is a mix of tactics and strategy. You have to play the first worker you draw from your stack but once you achieved 5 books in your library you may choose which worker to play. You have to time the placement and activation of your workers in various locations so they resolve optimally (especially if you're playing with less than 5 books in your library). 
+ Some memory and bluffing aspect as workers are placed face-down. You have to guess where opponents' saboteur is which cancels out your worker's ability.
+ Saboteur mechanic really shines and increases excitement of the game while introducing a good level of take that. 
+ Multiple scoring opportunities from stealing buildings to missions to constructing your machine.
+ Variable player powers. 

- Production is great with the minis but the bolts and plates chits are miniscule. They want to keep the player board size manageable but it is a mismatch in quality when there are miniatures scientists when those could have easily been tokens. Double layered player boards would have been nice with the plates and bolts being cubes that can slot in. 
- I initially thought each villain was linked to a particular machine but apparently they were just illustrations. Would have been nice to see some kind of backstory to increase immersion.
- Rulebook could have been clearer and needs a section for each of the machines unique powers.

A solid light to mid weight game that pleases across the board with a little bit of everything and does not overstay its welcome."
22,buffcoat,N/A,"The minis are perfect. Everything else is, meh. Thin player boards, extremely fiddly and tiny pieces. A deeper than expected worker placement/engine builder than I thought it would be. "

24,calidoggg,8,"So far, I really enjoy this game.  I love the delayed action resolution mechanism and the stacking.  It has some challenging decisions along the way, but doesn't overstay its welcome and seems fairly balanced.  The asymmetric machine powers are the greatest part of the game for me, though.  Without that, I wouldn't rate this as high as an 8."
25,CannonFodderTed,7.9,"I actually really liked this game. Fun gameplay, great components, doesn't overstay its welcome. I really love the mechanic of placing your cogs face down as it makes for some very interesting decisions and also has that ""I hope my opponent doesn't do this"" feeling which keeps the game tense. Quite a good little gem which I think is probably overlooked this year."
26,cbazler,5.5,"A couple nice ideas here, but the game is almost too simple for me. The bluffing/blind worker-placement works to a degree, but not with two players, when it's too easy to track and remember player tokens: it often becomes obvious which tokens are traps, and it can stall the game if both players simply avoid those spots. I also think the game is slightly too repetitive to reward multiple plays: it seems the only real interest is in the complex interactions of multiple players."
27,Celtic Joker,8,"I'm not a Worker Placement fan at all!
But this one is fun for me because you always have enough workers and you can always go to any space. It's just a matter of choosing which worker (they have different abilities) to send to which space."
28,Chabousse,6,"Very interesting ""Chips programming"" mechanic. Played the prototype and the published game, not convinced."
29,charlest,6.4,"I'm not a fan of worker placement but the adoption of the StarCraft-like system really jazzes this up. There's a bit of chaos and direct conflict (sabotage) that really alleviates some of my pain points with the classic mechanism.

I also dig how you're building doomsday devices and unlocking special powers and attributes. This just feels great and ties in wonderfully with the absolutely breezy gameplay. Everything moves extremely fast and it's not overly thinky or analytical. It's a gateway+ worker placement game that's streamlined but still interesting with a touch of flavor.

I really like this game. The mechanism with discs is very nice. The only thing I dislike is that someone can luckily copy an engineer and start his engine and get a lot of stuff. That's also what happened in our play, and this person won. Some of the individual characters are overpowered?

Overall, it is a decent game that plays fairly quick. The theme is also decent enough to inspire an occasional devious laugh when you trump your fellow masterminds. Stacked worker placement mechanics can be tough to figure out, but this one handles it well. The progression from building up your secret weapon of mass deviousness is handled PERFECTLY. Things to watch out for: The Saboteur, is really just not fun. The randomness of placements usually from the agents means that randomly you will just outright lose a turn. This is tough no matter the play count. 2 players its brutal, more players and you might lose a couple agents in a row. It's not a long game and it's not entirely uneven so it is not the end of the world, but I can easily see some people having issues with it. The other thing is C.L.A.W.S. . . . . I don't know HOW this thing was playtested. If you do use it, please use the variant offered by Eric Lang. Having the engineer's ability used to hop from stack to stack, is just broken. Even with the fix it is pretty unbalanced over the other abilities, but much better than without."

Each city gives some kind of resource and each agent has a special ability or action, such as capturing a building or fulfilling a mission. You unlock new powers as you build parts of your nefarious machine. The game has enough strategy to keep serious gamers engaged, but it can be a bit chaotic, especially with the saboteur agent."

The lack of control on the order of placement resolutions along with the saboteur make it hard to plan ahead.  A bit too chaotic for my tastes."

While Europe sits unprotected in Victorian Masterminds, you and other players send your henchmen to different cities to use their varied abilities, collect material for your steampunk-inspired contraptions, destroy buildings, and complete missions. At the same time, the Secret Service follows your path of destruction. Every contraption is unique and allows you to take different actions, leading to highly strategic, asymmetric gameplay."
89,Hummel150,3,"Rich theme, big names, wonderful artwork and quality miniatures yet such a bland result. Not representative of either author's best work. 

The game is shallow and turns are samey so you see it all with one play. No reason to re-visit. "
90,iamzimmer,6.9,"Decent gateway for worker placement games. The workers are discs with a bonus effect on one side. Your 5 workers are shuffled, so you will place the next one from your stack on an action space that you would like to do, face-down. Eventually when there are 3 workers total in the action space, the action is resolved in order of 1st worker, 2nd worker, 3rd worker. 

The worker bonuses give you something extra to consider when placing--if you have your 2X worker, you might be more inclined to place your worker on an empty space (because the bonus cannot be canceled). If you have the bonus canceler, you might want to place it either 1st or 2nd in an action space, to have a chance at messing with someone else's plans. Etc. Likewise, after an action space is resolved, the workers are returned face-up to their owners (ie: a ""discard pile""), and are not flipped face-down and shuffled until the owner has an empty stack. So you can see if someone has already used their bonus canceler, etc.

So it is kind of neat. But it also just feels very tactical/not very deep. The bits are pretty, and the game moves quickly. I would not mind playing again, but not one I would request either."

98,John501,7.5,With three or more players Victorian Masterminds is a very fun worker placement game with some unique features that set it apart from the crowd. The production holds to CMON’s usual top shelf standard and the theme/setting is likely to appeal to both young and old. A terrific next step for families that are getting into gaming and a simple-but-still-satisfying lark for more experienced players.

Plays quickly, though the decisions feel like they have weight. It reminds me of playing Istanbul in that respect (it's also a bit of an efficiency race as well).

128,mxke,1,"Pasted on theme worse than a Reiner Knizia classic. Random worker placement power availability=a shame to call it worker placement.  Access to main scoring dictated by a track which makes the game mono strategic. Maybe other routes could work but you'd have to fully commit to an alternative strategy from the start of the game without wavering. Because WP locations only activate when the 3rd worker is placed, players can be both intentionally and unintentionally blocked out of obtaining as many actions as other players. This last point is how the game is broken. 

Not worth playing."
129,Mythologem,7,"Kinda simple point-salad, it has one big plus and that's the nasty-guy-machine building, like a jigsaw puzzle - it's quite a big fun.

Game per se is a tad uninteresting in the long run, the whole hidden action programming works with less fun than in, say, Colt Express (or Roborally, even).

It's really between 6 and 7, but the components are very solid, so rounding up.

172,terrychu,7.4,"A very “CMON / Eric Lang” game

From design prospective, it is a pretty streamline and clean one that has easy-to-learn mechanism and medium level of depth. The chips “worker placement” mechanic is nice and the way to score is creative. The only drawback is a game feel a bit dry and a bit repetitive. Guess it is because it doesn’t have a long term goal and the game is not short enough to avoid the repeating feeling. 

For game component, it is like any other CMON game that is not lack of quality. The chips is good but not as good as clay chips and the board to build the robots is a nice component but not top one.  

Overall, it is a good design game (like what Eric normal does) and good but not great game component (as CMON does)  is worth to try it and see whether fit to your taste.

188,WLMIV,7,"On initial thoughts after playing.  It is fun and a good game, You will not comprehend all that is happening until mid-way through your first game.

There is a lot of planning involved with the placement of your agents. What do you want to do and what can you do in relation to the other players. There are many options for you to choose. Still  you must watch what others are doing to avoid getting shafted. 

Building the machines is fun as well. 

The components for the buildings, scientists, and monuments are really nice. 

On the other hand

The rule book is not great.

The machine parts are really small. Cubes or some type of mini (since it is CMON), would have been nice for the firepower token. 

It seems too easy to take the major monuments.

In my opinion the game needs a score pad, a players aid, and a glossary explaining the mission cards. It would have been worth the extra cost.

I am a little disappointed though. I did have higher hopes for the game. It has so much potential that may have been cut away for business purposes.
