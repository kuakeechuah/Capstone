0,0 1 1 2 3 5 8,6.7,Well... it's area control so I didn't have high hopes anyhow. People say it's Euro-y but to me felt deckbuilder-ish. Lots of combining card features and choosing which tactical combination to use in a given situation. It's not terrible and I see why people like it but I won't be playing again anytime soon. 
1,1000rpm,8,"8 is a tentative rating after one play. Was great fun, seemed really balanced, tactical and loved the acceleration in the game, kind of opposite to 7 wonders"
2,1CHNUP,N/A,"First impression - Very strong drafting and area of control game. This is not my style of game, but I really enjoyed the way that it played. Glad that I was able to learn it!
"
3,2d20,8,Very enjoyable and liked it even more than expected. Card driven game with many paths to victory! For me it lives up to the ratings. Sadly it won't get to the table very often because of my group dynamics.
4,2dTones,6,"More accessible and streamlined than its predecessor Chaos in the Old World, but loses some depth and tension as a result. It's also possible for players to be noticeably knocked out of contention very early on. Still an enjoyable romp I'm happy to play on occasion."

6,383cherokee,8,Blood rage that's how I should start when I talk about this game. In the first phase of the game you start setting yourself up to destroy your enemies. The ability to also have monsters Aid you in your battles should Intrigue anyone. If anyone ever asked to play this game I will never turn it down.
7,3davoli,10,"First play:1\23\16 2 and a half hours (3 people did research on the game, 4th was in for a game at the last minute, all had not played before.)

I rated it a 10 in December 2015, (after watching videos, I was psyched!) so I rated it a 10 before playing, Was I hasty? 

NO! It was that good! 

Oh yeah, I forgot to say I WON AT 125 points! (every one else gave me loki cards in the draft.) 

I got 4 figures destroyed in Ragnorok (16) times 2 for double all glory in by dying in Ragnorok. then I had 3 glory each person released from Valhala (2 cards) 8 people released (24) those two things were almost half my victory! 

phenomenal combos, leading into an awesome game!

41,adammale,10,"Blood Rage is one of the few area control with action points allowance system & card drafting that I like, because even in death I can still gain glory! It doesn't take long time to finish, the rules are streamlined & easy to understand though there are few cards that's a bit confusing, plus the minis are super awesome! The clans are all cosmetic only with no variable clan power but I still wish for the Ram clan hahaha! The game reminds me of Cosmic Encounter, Game of Thrones, Smallworld & King of Tokyo. "
42,adamscott,7,"Good game, but it's pretty random until everyone is familiar with the cards."
43,adamsinger109,9,"Everything about this game is great. The theme, the drafting, the fighting, and of course the miniatures. "
44,AdamStarks,5,"I'm only rating it this high because I'm aware that one play is not enough to fully judge any game, but man did I not have a good time. Aside from the standard thing of not knowing what any of the other cards were (much less how they fit into the game), you can still only get a heads up on ~2/3rds of all the cards in the draft. Even if you do know what your opponent has, you can easily find yourself strategically blocked off by their combination of cards and positioning, leaving you mostly unable to score in the 3rd age.

Maybe it'd get better with more plays, in which case I'll update this. But holy hell was that a bad first impression."
45,adamw,8,"Finally got a play this one at Gen Con with gods and mystics expansions. Great fun! I recall playing the previous incarnation Midgard and remarked how wonderful it was in mechanics. Well, it holds up well for sure - and the dress up by Cool Mini certainly adds to the flare and fun. Very fun drafting (a mechanic I find I don't often like), wonderful power ups and area/battle control where dying itself is often to your benefit! The gods expansion adds variety, so good all around. Lots of love."

48,Adanedhel,5.5,"Un juego muy sobrevalorado (porque entra por los ojos por las minis), y sobretodo, un despropósito total al estar troceado entre expansiones que lo hace valer una salvajada. Sólo he probado el juego base, y cualquier otro juego de mayorías al que he jugado le da mil patadas a éste. Hay cosas absurdas y el azar está bastante presente y descompensado, en el tema de las cartas.

El del Padrino, del mismo autor, es más sencillo y a la vez el juego está más pulido y es mejor (o al menos más divertido)"
49,adaz,9,super fun game. took a bit to get going but it was awesome.
50,adebisi,6,"Blood Rage sure has cool miniatures (or not). Mounting the minis onto a removable bases of varying colours is also a neat solution to denote the owner of the monster. Rules are rather simple and the game can be started quite quickly. 

It is nice that you decide your strategy on the basis of the initial card draft. Thus you can play differently from game to game, sometimes you even have to if you do not get the cards needed for a certain strategy. I also liked that there are two more drafting rounds, when you can make changes to your strategy if needed, or push even further along the path you chose initially.

However, already after the first game everyone in our group felt that we had seen every trick you can pull off during a game, take a few we could not think of. I was not left with an urge to play again to try something different. I take this as a sign of a rather one dimensional game. Yes, the play was fun but it is a shame if you ""crack"" the code at the first play.

One more thing worth mentioning is the absolutely horrible choice of font. Despite being printed in big and bold the names of the areas are really difficult to read.

The conclusion says that Blood Rage is a nice game but I am afraid it is rather short lived, unless expansions introduce some longevity elements to it."
51,AdelinDumitru,8.2,"I can see why some people might prefer it with 4, but I enjoyed very much my first play with my girlfriend. I guess we're going to love it even more after we become more accustomed to the cards. for instance, I wasted the first age after my girlfriend played that card that steals rage after a fight and i had only kept 1 rage....next time i'm going to be a lot more careful"

57,adrianliew93,6.5,"A very streamline game with different mechanics in it. The combat system was not so difficult yet thematic enough.

85,ajewo,8.5,"Area control card drafting game by Eric M. Lang (Rising Sun, Chaos of the Old World) with well produced miniatures.

Pros:
+ Theme (Vikings, Valhalla, Pillaging, fantasy, not very historic)
+ Components (great detailed miniatures)
+ Card drafting offers different strategies: combat, Loki, quests, upgrades
+ Area control: as soon as someone pillages an area all other surrounding players can intervene and move into that area for battle
+ Limited spots for each area
+ Map gets tighter each round (one area gets destroyed)
+ Lost units can score points (Loki, Valhalla)
+ Symmetric clans which will become asymmetric by individual clan upgrading
+ Simple core, game offers some depth
+ Easy to teach
+ Game length feels right

Neutrals:
# Language dependent: text on cards
# Variability: different cards each game, random pillage token distribution on the map
# Artwork is good for characters and monsters. I do not like the landscape, I miss contrast, cleanness, smooth transitions. The tiles and card back could look better as well in my opinion.
# Potential for run-away leader
# Best with 3-4 players

Similar games:
* Inis (area control, card drafting with fixed number of cards, no upgrading your faction, more euro-style, less battle-oriented)
* Court of the Dead: Mourners Call (area control, card drafting, semi-cooperative, different factions and guilds)
* Tsukuyumi: Full Moon Down (area control, asymmetric factions, no luck, card drafting, NPC faction)
* El Grande (pure / abstract area control, card selection)
* Chaos in the Old World (hand management, tight area control with a lot of interaction between the factions by Eric M. Lang)
* Rising Sun (area control with negotiation and bidding by Eric M. Lang)"

Some interesting mechanics, but I found the game fairly light relative to my tastes. We'll see how this changes after a few more playthroughs and at diff player counts, but I found the game went way too quickly and was pretty anticlimactic.

Maybe I was just expecting too much given the hype and long wait for this... My husband enjoyed it quite a bit."
89,Akado,3,"Was neat, and there was a lot of room for good moves, great moves, and dbag moves.  The clan stats seemed to be a lost or underutilized opportunity, as they did not impact gameplay very much at all during the one play.

96,Akrimas,9.5,Enjoy that game very much! Starting on equal ground and gaining the asymmetry through drafting is really nice. 
97,akron,8,"Intuitive game with drafting, action-point allowance system and area-control. I really enjoy playing this game even though I am not very good at it. 

I like that there are many different ways to score points in this game. Some tactics even revolve around dying in a region. The skill in the game is to draft a good combination of cards and to use them at the right time. This is not easy as you also have other priorities on the map.

The game works well with both 2, 3 and 4 players. I think I prefer it with 4 though because of the more caotic nature of it. I have not played it with 5, but  I will do as soon as I get my hands on the 5th player expansion. Maybe it is better than 4, or maybe it is too much chaos. Who knows?

I'm not a big fan of ""exclusive"" content, especially when it feels like that exclusive content is probably necessary to have a complete game.  I'm not sure if it's a game that will have a ton of replay, depending on how much control over the types of cards you can get.

2nd play: This game was excellent the second time.  Having an idea of what could be played added an additional depth to the game, and the mystics were worthwhile to add.  I'm still not a fan of the exclusive content, but the game was great overall.  Drafting was tight and I saw new paths to victory I had missed the first time through.  Quite excellent."

Models are amazing, artwork is stunning.

Game play, I have really enjoyed this game a lot, the draft mechanic works really well. The different strategies are fun and very menacing.
In a 4 player game everyone is very engaged, which makes the game very neat and interesting till the end.
I also found the 2 player game works really well, i was expecting it to be a let down, but it proved me wrong.

I see my self playing this game a lot more."
153,amethyst246,6.5,Much faster and more compact gaming experience than I was expecting.  Love that combat is not determined by dice. Looking forward to playing again.
154,amish_rabbi,7,Good game even if I never win it. I would buy it but everyone else owns it and I just don't like unpainted minis :p would buy a meeplized version of it though.

158,anatana,9,"I liked this WAY more than I expected to. The draft is delicious and presents some difficult choices, and allows for some planning as well. The area control works well, death has some sting but it never feels mean, and you can turn losses into wins if you plan it well. The blind card play for combat feels very fair as well, since losers get their cards back, and the cards have enough trickeration that you can never be fully sure what the right play is. Leveling up your clan seems to be important above all else, I got +50 pts from level bonuses at game's end, which was nearly half my points. Our quests had people working different areas, would be interesting to see more overlap, although we had PLENTY of conflict. Would be down to play again any time.

also: this is one of the few games I would recommend a broken token for. You aren't getting the expansions in the box without it"

170,Andrewthor,8,"Epic!!! Very balanced and visually stunning. I'd like to ""use"" better all those minis...."
171,Andy Parsons,7,"Blood Rage is at heart a streamlining of Lang's earlier Chaos in the Old World with the action transferred to a world of Norse mythology. The competing Viking clans are undifferentiated at the start, but gradually grow more asymmetric through the drafting of upgrades.  The game is less about area control than its forefather; only drafted quest cards reward it.  The focus has switched to winning battles, progressing along three tracks and sending souls to Valhalla.  Some card combos do seem very powerful and there is less variety in the cards than I'd have hoped (a consequence of streamlining?).  All the same, it plays quite smoothly, the tight limits on area occupancy reward forward planning, and the shrinking play area ensures plenty of conflict.

I like the artwork and the minis are very good indeed. The one misstep is the clan of chainmail bikini clad Viking babes."

185,Annowme,N/A,":arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
An everyone-is-equal area control game that grows more and more asymmetric as players draft unique cards around the table over three rounds. Glory equals victory points, and glory is won both from winning [i]and[/i] losing battles, completing area control quests, sinking ships, slaying monsters, and pumping up the traits of your battle clan. Don't be fooled, this is not brainless Ameritrash. In fact, it's one of the most finely-honed hybrid games I've ever played.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
I love drafting. But I like drafting the most when it makes sense thematically. 7 Wonders? That doesn't make sense. Sushi Go Party!? That makes a lot of sense. Blood Rage? That makes a lot of sense, too. Players are clans who are effectively bidding for favor from the gods of the Norse pantheon at Ragnarok--these gods need the help of the players to close the end of time, and they dole out their boons to the players on a first-come, first-served basis. Do you want to summon all of the most amazing elemental monsters of the realm? Draft the monster cards from the gods. Do you want to fall on your sword/axe/pike and still gain glory? Draft the Loki cards. Do you want to make your name great in the annals of forgotten history? Draft the Odin cards. Each game I play, it seems as though the progressive asymmetry of the drafting really evokes the desperate theme of the world coming to an end, with only so many able warriors and tacticians left to usher in the apocalypse. In addition to the thematic/mechanical consistency, combat is simple, but also affords an excellent bluffing aspect through card play. This game is FAST, but packs in a ton of tension, player interaction, and satisfying moments within the system.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Like any asymmetrical game, the fabric of the table can become increasingly fragile if players do not understand no only their own strategy and tactics, but those of their opponents. If the Loki-heavy player is taunting you to pillage so they can send all of their units to die, don't pillage. Quest instead, and deny that player his obvious setup. That said, this weakness for potential fragility is also the greatest strength of the game, as the progressing asymmetry can be incredible if crunched by savvy players."

190,AnotherHorrorFan,7,"A huge disappointment for me. I am giving it a 7 because it is a legitimately good game, but the game has some base mechanic issues which can allow for a run away leader problem. I need to play it at least once or twice more before I am sure of my feelings on it, but at least for now I feel like the game has a misleading burden of knowledge that can make the game get out of control.

2019-02 Update: One of these days I am giving this game a second chance. Evin almost ruined it for me altogether, but I know there is greatness in here, if not for that brutal combo. Also Sam Healey is my guru and it is his number one.

It's a card drafting game that happens to have miniatures. If you know the card pool the best, it is most likely that you will combo out with your draft, and then tend to win. There doesn't seem to be much board strategy beyond that."

I guess I just figured it would be nonstop combat, and was pleasantly surprised by how much more is going on. There seem to be an awful lot of strategies one can pursue, and probably a lot of variation between games. (The people I played with had all kinds of stories about past games.) Definitely worth exploring further."
222,arcweldx,7.3,"A game about battling Vikings is something I'm predisposed to be lukewarm about. I don't like direct conflict games, especially of the dice chucking, conquest and fighting over territory variety. Blood Rage is none of those things. It's not even really about Vikings but rather a fantasy Norse mythology world. The game is essentially a euro where you draft cards in order to build combos and point-gaining engines, and then tactically move around pieces on a limited map to gain said points. Fighting is better described as ""area majority"" and often you don't even want to win. Might be a little too chaotic and random for my liking (and I'm usually fond of a healthy dose of both). The main downside is that if (like me) you don't care about miniatures, the minis make the game far more expensive than I'd normally want to pay for a game like this."
223,ardimus,1,"I played this game once. After the first of 3 rounds, I honestly thought we had the rules incorrect, as the game was so bad that I was certain that we had missed something.

- Starts symmetrical and uses card drafting to become asymmetrical
- Multiple strategies for winning

- Very balanced, good play is rewarded, while mistakes and setbacks don't elliminate you

238,Arklay,9.5,"Es un juego emocionante y competitivo. Puedo decir que en este juego en verdad sientes el poder de ir mejorando poco a poco y eso, pocos juegos los logran. El sistema de draft de cartas deja en el jugador toda la responsabilidad de si gana o pierde. Las figuras son muy bonitas, y la temática vikinga está perfectamente lograda.

¿Lo Mejor? Hay varios caminos que conducen a la Victoria, en cada partida siempre eliges uno diferente.

¿Lo Peor? No se lleva el 10 porque para tener una partida satisfactoria debes de conocer todas las cartas de antemano y planear un poco qué cartas usar y combinar con las de la siguiente era.

¿Que le cambiaría? La caja. Es muy difícil de guardar las figuras cada partida. Necesitas comprar o hacerle un inserto si quieres ahorrar tiempo, aunque no es obligatorio."
239,ArkTraveler,7,"A sub-hour strategy game, Blood Rage is a drafting game with area control/combat elements and impressively large and detailed miniatures. More so than some other drafting games, it's critical to be familiar with the full deck--as card text in many cases hard counters straightforward high value cards.

Great artwork on the cards and game board, and absolutely gorgeous minis (I've just done 2 clans and some monsters). If you are into painting the figures and are good at it, you'll have a work  of art game. It's not too complex to exasperate a player yet not too simple, it's just right. Not surprised at all that it was made by teh same guy who did my favourite Chaos in the Old World."
244,Aroach88,8,"I love it, a semi-euro with card drafting and gorgeous miniatures.

298,axelgaffer,6.9,"Surprisingly simple and quite beautiful. The pace seems heavily dictated by which red cards people draft and decide to play, so there's a lot of bluffing which isn't always my cup of tea but it can be exciting. 

Also in both of my first two games the troll's ability to completely wipe an area upon entry felt very oppressive.

The scores were never close by the end. My first impression is that this game feels interesting to play but not amazing. Considering the high price tag, I don't think I'd recommend it necessarily. I will try it more in the future and see if it clicks better."
299,Axelsander,6.5,"I wonder how many people give this game 8-10 stars just because the nice miniatures and not because of the actual game. Also i believe many people really WANT this game to be better than it is, peuple have payed a lot and invested a lot of hope in the game. 

It’s a nice game. My main complaint is that one pays such a heavy price. I guess that’s becuase of the plastic figures. However they don’t improve the actual gameplay, and for this price I would actually like a somewhat better game. I guess this is a lesson for me about that price can be absurd if there is plastic figures, but that the game in itself might not be THAT good. I feel like many might give it such high score because of the plastic figures.

Also, i wish there was a way to buy the monsters from the kickstarter, in an expansion. Because, why not, always fun to paint. Though ofcthey would nor really improve gameplay. Will definitely try the gods of asgard, because, again; why not."

319,BadgerGatan,5.1,"After my first play of Blood Rage, I walked away from the game thinking that I hated the Dudes on a Map genre. I figured that I liked video games with tactical mechanics, but that board games simply didn't lend themselves to a compelling troops-management game. However, I realize now that I was very, very wrong. I love the genre Blood Rage is in. I just really dislike Blood Rage.

This is because, strategically, Blood Rage feels half-baked. Sure, it appeals to the Kickstarter crowd: it's got lots of STUFF (Viking minis, player boards, decks of cards, secret tiles, and so on) and the minis are admittedly one of my favorites parts of the game. It maintains a strong theme with good components. But as far as pros... that's really it.

The ability to make informed decisions in Blood Rage is mediocre. Everything feels like a gamble - allocating troops across the map is relatively expensive, and when you allocate them, you can't guarantee even a decent return. You could win the battle, and your opponents will still be better off if their secret cards were better than yours. If you win a battle, which is expensive, you might find out that the region bonus isn't good for your strategy. 

Drafting combat/upgrade cards mitigates some of the luck, but when picking cards (especially first round), you don't have enough information about the board state to evaluate whether a strategy is good for you. Then, each subsequent round of drafting becomes more informed, but either (a) you focus on your own strategy and let the next player get an objectively more powerful card, or (b) you hate-draft and sink both of your strategies. As a system for distributing combat cards, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Blood Rage has good storytelling. I remember how every game went, even months later. I remember some ridiculous combos. Despite some oddities, I don't actually hate it as a game - I could be talked into it, since Blood Rage is better than nothing. But as a game, it made me feel like tactics were so arbitrary that I thought every genre-adjacent game was just as bad. I felt like any agency I had was negated by unbalanced strategies, and when I did well, I didn't feel like it had anything to do with my performance as a player.

Blood Rage is a game I really want to be good - everything about the theme, delivery, and even the gameplay loop seems like I should love it as much as I love Kemet, Scythe, or Root. But I don't.

I confess that I do like all of the mechanics, the theme, the bits (phenomenal, art included) - but they just don't add up to fun for me here. People drop cataclysmic card combos that are (for the most part) completely out of your control.  I don't mind being struck by a natural disaster, but I prefer a hurricane over an earth quake.  At least a hurricane shows up on radar & gives you time to prepare.  Earthquakes are just throwing your hands in the air and thinking wtf? "

It sure is not a 2p game of course though, so didn't get the full feeling of the game. It definitely plays within the advertised time (it took me 1h20min including rules explanation) which is a great plus for a Risk-like game that doesn't want to overstay its welcome. All in all, not a fantastic or innovative game as people might say (Dice-tower dudes, i'm looking your way) but one that I can easily see myself bringing on the table every now and then (as long as my girlfriend is not playing, she craved for blood after our session, particularly mine since I won :P )"

This game is fantastic.  However, I should not that it is easy for someone to min-max in a two player game.  This doesn't make the game bad, it just makes it easy for someone to plow right over the board.

Second Play 11/30/15

This game is still fantastic but the idea of min-maxing is still possible.  The game was a bit more intense this time, but still a min-maxing possibility.  Two player games are much more interesting because there are three destroyed areas at the beginning instead of the one area in the four player game.  Also, we noticed that both the fire giant and the sea serpent are not available in the two player game which took something away.  So I am looking forward to playing this game with four people."

The rules are very streamlined: the game lasts three Ages (rounds), and each has five phases. The core of the game are the first two: drafting god's rewards cards, and alternating in taking actions (like play cards, deploy or move miniatures, pillage provinces).

Each player has a clan, and everything is symmetrical at the beginning, but during play every clan takes its own shape in something unique (it is kinda Chaos in the Old World where you build the asymmetry instead of beginning the game with it...).

An interesting game, lighter than it seems, and very enjoyable."

The game isn't deep enough and lacks a certain finesse. I think it would benefit for a bigger variety of cards. You'll see many duplicates or slighter different versions across the ages with only the amount of points you receive being different. If you want a game with drafting, there are far better choices. I just find it to be a little too random as it is hard to establish a real strategy when you often have no chance to further that strategy in later rounds if you can't obtain needed cards. If you want a game with area control and lots of battles, there are far better choices. This one isn't great at either. The good thing is, gameplay seems to be pretty quick.

Obviously, the strategy here is completely dependent on the cards you draft. The Clan Upgrades in particular were super useful (ex. Pillage an already Pillaged area again). The Monsters seemed not as powerful as I would have thought. Maxing out your Rage stat early also seems to be a must strategy. Need to give this some more plays to see if it grows on me. "
430,BigMoneyNichols,10,"Chasing multiple paths to victory as the world ends- what more could one ask for? The Viking theme fits so well, and the small map makes for epic battles over small spits of land as you and your opponents fight for superiority in area control, battle dominance, and even DEATH. The choice of which gods, upgrades and monsters to call upon for favor in the initial draft frames your turn, and the fun of the game is bringing those plans to fruition. This game is a huge accomplishment."

446,bjhenderson,9,Blood Rage is a drafting/hand management/area control game with a Viking theme.  It implements the theme well.  Combat is encouraged and essential for victory.  Multiple paths to victory ensure the game plays differently every time.  Enjoyed it.
447,bkelly17,8,"I was resistant to the hype, but this is a great game. A area of control/drafting game masquerading as a combat game, it is surprisingly easy to teach. There is something incredibly gratifying about slamming your giant monster down on the board as well."

In a Viking game, I'm expecting for fights to be rewarded but I feel that fighting is the least viable strategy here. Loki > Stats/Mission > Fighting

As a house rule, I would recommend removing the 2 Loki cards (Steal Rage) of the First Age/Era. This has improved my enjoyment of the game significantly ! "

This is usually not my type of game, but the fun factor when playing with family and friends is high... The drafting is interesting once you know the cards; the minis are very nicely done; the artwork is gorgeous and the gameplay is solid for what it is. Bring your big boy pants because you are going to be killed in battle a lot! It is an area control and ""take that"" game that plays quickly once the rules overhead is gone.

490,boardmathias,4,"Middle weight game, that mixes something similar to area control, with drafting and tableau building. There are amazing combos. Some of these seam unbalanced. Since the cards are drafted, you could sabotage combos, but to do this you need to know the game. But playing multiple rounds of a game, that may take 3 hours, to find out if it is fun?"
491,BoardOne,7,"Not sure why but several plays of this game resulted in a run away leader.  Not the same person each time, but our experience is sometimes a person gets extra lucky on the combination of cards they pick up and the game becomes uncompetitive.   That said , its a game where 'losing' your pieces can still be a benefit for you and this always takes the edge off 'losing' them.  I like it for that, great miniatures for people who don't like miniature games."
492,BobbyReichle,7,"Being able to make a bet against losing battles and have that as a workable strategy for winning this game really makes this game worthwhile. It's hard to feel like you aren't advancing a strategy so long as you're keeping your wits about you. The setup time is long, but the learning curve isn't punishingly steep, so you can set up a game, and after you learn the game, get right into the meat of the action, which is nice."
493,bobbyrs,8,"Minis are painted. Big 4 monsters and long ships fully painted. Viking clans and small monsters just have the bases painted (blue, brown, yellow and red; black for small monsters) with a matching shade applied to the rest of the figure. Same treatment for the fifth player expansion (green) hence they really need to be sold together "

495,Bobonthecob,10,"Up front, as of writing this, this is my favorite game of all time. So this will just be a list of things I love about the game. Amazing artwork and implementation of one of my favorite themes (vikings). Excellent miniatures, especially the monsters, which by the way, can be yours to control! The miniatures in this game actually made me get into painting miniatures. Drafting for battle cards, upgrades, controllable monsters, and goals for the round all occur at the same time, which leads to people being able to do the strategy they want to do. This game is about getting glory (vikings would be proud) rather than simply winning battles. While winning battles is certainly a good thing, there is plenty of opportunity to get glory by dying in battle, or better yet, in the glorious destruction that is Ragnarok.

Honestly this game appeals to Amerithrash and eurominded gamers alike, and while there is a little too much going on for those who avoid a decent amount of strategy,  most gamers will get this quickly, and will leave with a mixture of satisfaction and longing for that one move back, followed by the desire to get right back into it. I find myself thinking about my plays long afterward and wanting to play again and again.

498,boettler,5,A 2-4 player game with a complexity rating of 2.87. It is hard to plan anything as the cards are unpredictable and so are the players movements.
499,boiledsteak,6,"This game converted very many of my friends into devoted board game players with growing collections.

Simple enough to understand quickly and the action happens RIGHT AWAY.

Because of this - I want to give it a straight up 10, but it's not quuiiiite complex enough for me and I've also just been straight up ganged up on for many rounds in a row during a few different plays - if that happens when your not prepared with any of the glory/don't lose a guy when you die cards ahead of time there's not a whole lot you can do about it, and then suddenly your 30+ points behind and your night's ruined.

At least in other war-ish games there's something meaningful you can still do if your just being triple-team curb-stomped...So for that, it gets a lower rating.

Another possible issue is that the art looks so 'metal' that it turns away more of my hippy friends."
500,boldleonidas,9,"What a fun game! Lots of miniatures, and (comparatively) quick easy rules. Could just play it again and again and still get such a kick out of it. Everyone having an all out fight when someone attempts to pillage the center is fantastic, get so caught up in having fun I forgot to win.

Only bad point is that it was a Kickstarter filled with exclusives... that I missed. It does seem the extras added to the gameplay experience and they are very hard/expensive to come across. So there is no real chance of me enhancing my game... which is a damned shame and an oversight by CoolMiniOrNot as they could have got more money out of me!"

506,bolton317,9,"Highly engaging game with great drafting and battle card mechanic. Great table presence. After everyone has played it 8 or so times it becomes really clear there is two basic strategies to win. Death strat and odins throne. Somebody from board game geek had made some professional quality expansions which I printed and stuck over the multilingual cards and that added many more strategies to win and increased the life of the game by about 10 plays. We also homebrewed 30 extra rules and random select 5 of them each game we play to ensure the game is different every time we play. 
The mystics expansion is essential and the gods expansion is optional. Can add confusion to new players but it is worth getting if your group is planning to play 5 or more games"
507,boltongeordie,6.5,"No idea why everyone is raving about this (unless it is the plastic minis, which always seem to turn excitable nerds on). It is a decent enough game, highly interactive with a number of routes to victory but almost indistinguishable from thousands of others like it (except for the minis). Won my first play but feel no need to ever play again."
508,Bombadillo,3,"I kept hearing Blood Rage was a revamp of Chaos in the Old World and as such I had high expectations from it: sadly, they were all let down the first time I played it. Blood Rage turned out as a dumbed down - and by far not an improved - version of the Warhammer game.

For all practical purposes, it’s an eurogamer’s combat game: that is, a game where players can plan almost everything, go for damage reduction rather than putting everything they have into winning and even arrange a defeat in combat from scratch just because losing a pillage grants them as many points as dominating it, if not more.

As a matter of fact losing battles rather than winning them looks like the best strategy in this game: now, I wonder, how can a combat game reward defeat - and a planned one, for that - more than success?

The simple answer is, it’s a game for those who have no risk appetite: not only is taking risks uneffective here but it also usually backfires as the rules want to prevent you from taking any risk. Unthematically enough, you are not allowed to act rashly but you are required to carefully optimize your every move.
Think, baby, burn your little brain and let the other players wait endlessly for your move. Does it sound any fun to you?

The lack of any dice rolls - that would add some needed randomness in combat - and the annoying card drafting at the beginning of each era as a way to even out the impact of a lucky or unlucky hand simply strengthen this feeling, as they both reward the intricacies woven by the strategically awarer players only: if you’re looking for interaction, theme and epic battles, Blood Rage is not the game for you."

510,Bond8089,9,"Initial Impressions:
--------------------
The card drafting in this one is fantastic.  Probably the most interesting area control I have ever played.  The mini's for this game are insane (especially the monster mini's).  I would be shocked if this does raise to a 10 rating with more plays.  I would also be shocked if this isn't my favorite game from 2015.  Just a fantastic game.  Eric Lang's best by far!"

The cards are all the same, you know all the game combos and all the dominant cards to draft, and there is one solution to keep the game fresh: play with good and experienced Blood Rage players. Game is really good when 3 or 4 people know how to play it and try to shut down enemy combos and insane cards. Even with that, there is a limit of games I can play.

526,BossMC,7.5,"Blood Rage is definitely a weird game. It's definitely not a wargame as you would normally suspect.

Let's start with the positive points. The models are gorgeous. The rulebook is well setup. The mechanics are simple and to the point. The game doesn't last that long. That's great. It's usually not clear who is going to win, but it is definitely clear who is going to lose. Having a short game makes that not a real problem. 

Initially when I bought the game, I hated the concept of combining a wargame with a draft after a couple of games. Winning a battle is not really a big deal in Blood Rage. It just depends on what combo you're going for. The combo's really drive your whole game. In that way Blood Rage is not really a wargame at all. It's a draft combo game with occasional combat. 

But now after 10+ playthroughs I have started to like the concept. I have come to terms with the fact that Blood Rage is simply not the wargame that I initially expected, but that it is something different. We know the card pool by now, we know what to expect. And then the fun and mindgames begin. I'm looking forward to play this game more often in the future."

565,Brother Jim,9,"This is an odd game that I am enthusiastic to play again. It's odd in that the thematic world of the minis, card text and narrative is so coherent but there the connection to the very mathy, combo mechanics seems to be more tenuous than would be expected given what you see when you open the box. Actually playing the game feels a bit like a direct confrontation version of Race for the Galaxy (a game I like a lot)...there is a lot of min/maxing, searching out combos, trying to figure out the chain of when to play certain card combos for maximum point gain. Rarely do I feel like saying, ""Roar!"" when I put a troll on the board or that I am pillaging when I pillage. As a mathy confrontation game is without question excellent and one I will enjoy playing in the future. The lack of immersion will just keep it from being a ten for me given my penchant for thematic games."
566,brothervm,6.6,"This was an intense game, and for the most part, fairly enjoyable. My first impression was that the box art does not at all match the theme of the game inside the box. The title is mildly off-putting and didn't clue me in at all to the fact that this was a Viking themed game. But that's just surface stuff and doesn't affect my score. My biggest gripe is that it is almost impossible to know what other player's clan or warrior upgrades are without constantly polling the table, and I missed recognizing what one warrior upgrade was at the opposite corner of the table that cost me the game on the very last turn before the third Ragnarok. On the plus side, I do like the plethora of choices available to a player each turn. Rating may improve upon further plays, but most in our game group have no desire to play it again."

I love the drafting of cards at the beginning of the round and then trying to deduct what each player is going for.  The gameplay is all about tactics and making tough decisions.  On to Valhalla!"

580,Bswart1,10,What an amazing dudes on a map/card game. I can’t say enough how great the drafting element of this game is! Also it is very easy to teach to any level of gamer!
581,btasam,3,"Blood Rage is a game that I really wanted to love, felt destine to love, didn't love and wondered if something was wrong with me. Nope, my friends are wrong. This game is garbage. At best, Blood Rage has been a flaming disappointment and here's why. 

In all of its ball-tickling grandeur, Blood Rage is a construct of stitched together uninteresting subsystems that are primarily driven by an overstretched card drafting mechanic. Perhaps the most obvious is combat which is resolved by an unimaginative card-reveal. This completely subverts the battle driven, glory-seeking theme and reduces it to a game of high card victory point grabbing but only if you win or lose in tandem with what you drafted prior. 

Don't get me wrong, if you like planning, drafting and implementing combos within a chaotic context, this game is perfect for you. The BGG meta is certainly filled with combo discussions and critiques. 

For me, Blood Rage is filled with so much action devaluation that I can't even enjoy my own cleverness and the only remedy seems to be playing it more."
582,btav,8,I didn't care for it much the first time I played but loved it the second and third time. Knowing the cards is key to enjoying the game.

Great miniatures and several different ways you can approach this game.  Depending on the God or Gods you decide to follow each round.  I have actually been destroyed in end game points by my daughter that chose to sacrifice every viking in her clan.  Very clever."
585,bucketochips,8,One of the best.
586,bucklen_uk,9,"Early days, need to play this more - but looking pretty good. I expect it to get much more play than CitOW.

It's a euro/trash hybrid, with interesting choices, even the draft is thematic (as the vikings did that to divide up their spoils after a raid ;)

Minis are over the top, but look great and the draft brings in variety. Seems ok at all player counts (haven't tried 5 yet).

589,buddyandy88,9,I was underwhelmed after being very excited to play it the first but subsequent plays I'm starting to really enjoy it. My initial play through I left feeling like the game was about a 6. Now I'm giving it an 8. After several more plays the game is going to a 9

Couldn't afford to buy the monsters I so badly wanted to play with, couldn't build any sort of strategy with the cards I ended up with, and once one player started winning, they completely ran away with the game, meaning the scoring track was just another reminder of how little I could do.

596,bukimi,8.2,Excellent strategy with many clever rules like card draft and many ways of scoring without need to win battles. Almost no randomness.

598,Bundyman,3,"After one play i can´t understand the good ratings (ok the figures are pretty done). Beside this, the theme fails a bit for me, better implementation seems Fire&Axe, because the northern mythologie does it not well enough with getting points for Valhalla (a kind of village with his death rewards?). Every player needs his kind of a game, but for me it´s hardly acceptable when losing a battle then getting a bunch of Victory points."

609,BWagsKP03,6,"Despite the hype around Blood Rage, I personally have found it wanting. The production is excellent, and the mechanics are fun. However, the game just feels pointless and unsatisfying at the end. Maybe it's the Ragnarok theme wherein the world ends and everybody dies, but even that kinda misses the mark as most of the board is still intact at the end.
This game is a smorgasbord of gaming elements...card drafting, upgrading, area control, and bluffing, combined with Euro scoring, but it feels like just a taste of each of these.
The game also suffers from a dominant strategy...whoever kills off their own units in the most productive fashion is usually the winner.
I see Blood Rage as kind of a ""Hey, check this out!"" sort of game. Cool components, silly premise, fun play, but lacks any interesting replayability. Not a keeper."
610,Bwpatterson95,8,"The first time I played this game I did not do very well. I just played it again recently and now that I had learned more of the rules and strategy, the game was a lot better for me. I didn't win, but I felt I had a better sense for what I was doing. Slow start to this one but it gets better by the round. I like that you can change strategy in between rounds based on the cards that you draft."

623,calbond,7,"12/30/15: First play. I own Midgard but haven't played in 6+ years, and remember little of the details. This definitely feels like that game though, except with the cool minis and way more card actions (including the monsters).

Two of us were new players and the third had played this 4 times before. It seemed like there were a lot of 'fiddly' rules on when things could happen and how cards could be played, and the punishment for being wrong on a rule could be quite severe. In many games being slightly wrong may mean a one or two point swing, but if you did something wrong here it often meant the difference in winning or losing a battle, and that just seemed like a huge impact.

Overall the production values are great, the battling without dice is a strong backbone mechanic for the game, and the card drafting and powers add a nice touch of variety. Definitely looking forward to playing this again with a firmer grasp on the rules. 

05/22/16: Second play, and this game dramatically improved. I had it at a 7 on the first playthrough, but really should have logged it as a 6. Turns out we had a few rules wrong that first play, and knowing better the game going in plus now playing as designed really worked to increase the enjoyment . Felt way more streamlined, less fiddly player interaction, and again, phenomenal production values. Now Jim just has to get his minis painted!

633,Canadiangamer,7,One of the most fun Dudes on a map game there is.  I'm not 100% convinced that it's balanced (Loki strategy wins an inordinate amount of the times we've played) but I'm not 100% convinced that matters.  It's a bloody fun time.
634,Cancelled,9,"My rating for this keeps going up. Three plays in two weeks, and i keep finding things in the strategy to love. such a strong game and while the chrome is unnecesary, boy does it bring people to the table."
635,candoo,6,"This is not an Ameritrash game that I thought it would be. 

Definitely better than the original Midgard which this game is based on.
Simple rules. Can get playing quickly. No convoluted combat. Lasts 1h45m. Doesn't over welcome its stay. It’s a surprisingly decent game. 

This is not really an area control game. You can get as many points losing battles as you can winning battles. At heart, the game is about drafting cards - getting the best card combo. It's not really about any conflict. Herein lies the problem. Since the card draft IS the game; the chrome, the board, and the ""combat"" are really rather extraneous. So aren't there better card drafting games?

The minis are completely unnecessary. Plain wooden cubes to represent caballeros or medieval Italian dudes could have been exactly the same game.

While I think this is an okay game, it is one of the most over rated and over hyped games on BGG. 

Fans of Blood Rage really ought to check out Cry Havoc. That title is infinitely more replayable. It is so much more dynamic. Has way more combos. The asymmetry is significant and exciting. And the combat so much more original. Yet it is ignored by the BGG community and is underrated and under hyped."
636,CanisPalus,10,Love this game! The card drafting is full of good and tough choices.  The area control aspect is intriguing with multiple strategies to get points.  The miniatures are outstanding.

Once upon a time there was a Kickstarter-campaign to a game called Blood Rage.
The game was really pretty looking with nice miniatures and artwork. But the gameplay wasn't convincing at all. So I let that campaign pass and bought some other games...

...a few months later that game was brought to the stores and people could play and review it.

Man, was I wrong.
This game is a real s***load of fun. I've seen a game of this and instantly fell in love with it.

Components, yeah, we don't have to talk about that.
The only two small complaints are the artwork of the board which somehow looks like it suffers television snow and the small cards with their bad cardstock. I'm not a big fan of this small format. Especially if you handle them a lot.

The game itself is absolutely awesome with a cool, simple but still very variable gameplay.

I especially like the fact that every strategy can work. Winning battles, loosing battles as well as no fighting at all, every possible strategy can work or fail.

Luckily the game is complete as a retail without the usual CMoN Kickstarter-exclusives (in this game there were just a few).

701,Cervian,8.5,"Blood Rage was a revelation. I never appreciated too much CMON games considering them terrible (Zombicide was really annoying). It is a simple control game, but with deep mechanics. Under few units and a very clever draft mechanism is hidden a wargame soul. Mechanics perfectly fitted to the setting.

Issue: Analysis Paralysis (very long drafts), maybe Loki strategy a little bit stronger than others."
702,cfarrell,7,"This is one of those games that I’ve enjoyed for a while then hit a really steep cliff. I think part of that is just that it never really got that much momentum in the groups I play with so it was a bit hard to get to the table, and then when I did played it was decent but not great, not deserving of the effort. But at the end of the day it’s just a minimally thematic King-of-the-hill wargame without much inspiration in the mechanics, and that’s not a great spot to be in. I think Chaos in the Old World was a better game framework, even if the execution left a lot to be desired. I dunno. It’s fine, but for me anyway, not worth the high price point and large amount of shelf space it requires. I’ll stick with El Grande or Conquest of Paradise.

—-

This has really grown on me; it's basically Chaos in the Old World finally done right. I find I miss a little bit of a randomness option in the combat, but that's just a preference; for what this is, it works quite well. Also nice that it's pretty short, comparatively. It is also, unfortunately, inordinately expensive; I wish it had been the $50-$60 game it feels like. The minis are super-photogenic though for Instagram."

As glory can be attained in many ways, even losing in battle, many different strategies can emerge based on what cards you have. The game also encourages action rather than sitting around and turtling, which is great, as turtling is a big reason that dudes on a map games tend to be lame.

Overall, a strong thematic game with some stuff there if you're usually more a fan of cube pushing as I am."

715,Chance Coal Bear,10,"Blood Rage is the most perfectly flawed game I can think of.  We call it Blood ""RageQuit,"" referring to how frustrating and angering the game can be when you play into another player's strategy.  It's about as direct interaction as game I've ever played, but still has some Euro-crunch to it too. 10/10."
716,Chanfan,7,"This is a preliminary rating, as I haven't played it enough. The components are quite good, of course. My first game was pretty good, but we didn't get to finish. The second game we corrected (hopefully) most of the play mistakes we had made. Due to smart play and good luck on one opponent, I got wiped off the map at the end of the first age, and spent the next two ages far enough behind the leaders to make play painfully frustrating at best. The person who placed second actually was ahead on the board scoring, but the leader tied up by the third age, and had about 40 more bonus points than the second place person. Nobody ended on the same side of the track, scoring-wise. 

I do want to play this more, but I have a feeling it reminds me why amaritrash style games are my least favorite (I still like them). This particular game seems fairly high in the luck department - getting a good combo of cards (and of course taking the right actions to exploit them). Our play time with three player was about 2 hours - some players being fairly AP prone - but of course it felt longer stuck with no shot at a rebound. 

I'll have to see with more plays, but I feel like other ameritrash style games either keep you more involved, or at least eliminate you."

721,ChargeTheCannons,9,"Vikings, card drafting, pillaging, controlling ancient monsters, gloriously entering Valhalla. What could be better!? I love the level of player interaction and that all the drafting is done all at once before the rest of the age. Area control is fun and I enjoy the different ability and limitations between the leader, ships, warriors, and monsters. It gives a nice variety without being overwhelming."
722,charleaux,7,"I'm admittedly not a fan of ""dudes on a map"" games, but Blood Rage did have a nice mix of Euro and Ameritrash mechanics. To point out the obvious, the minis are awesome and the game looks great on the table. I also enjoyed the card drafting at the beginning of each age to help formulate an overall strategy and introduce some asymmetry between the clans via upgrades. My biggest complaint is that I felt it was hard to really put those strategies into action with the board being so tight in the second half of the game. I felt like my moves were dictated by other people's actions and I just had to react to them instead of focusing on my strategy. But I;m definitely willing to try it again."
723,charlest,9,"Absolutely fantastic.  A tighter yet more wily Chaos in the Old World that runs smoother.  Perhaps the pinnacle of Ameritrash/Euro hybrid.

This would be the perfect game if we had alternate Age decks so the cards/combos didn't get repetitive.  The content discovery aspect of this game is the only thing weighing it down as it feels much quicker to experience and understand than something like Chaos in the Old World.  

Love the game and it's so close to being perfect.

I would enjoy playing this more, and get to know the cards better, so that we could play with the drafting rules, but it seems pointless to do so unless we all had more foreknowledge of what we were looking for.  It's what puts me off games with drafting elements that are present while trying to teach the game.  I don't know what to do to make this work for me with games like these."

Hay varias estrategias viables para poder ganar en este juego e incluso uno puede ganar siempre perdiendo en las batallas, además cuenta con unas miniaturas que son de muy buena calidad, las miniaturas siempre hacen un juego de mesa mucho más bonito a la vista."

736,Cheesechick,7,"Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Not exactly in love with this, but not bad either. The combat is a bit on the bland side, but the card combos are sufficiently compelling and they're the real meat of the game. The way pillaging works and the Rage resource management work together nicely to give the game some interesting timing considerations. 

I suppose though, if I'm going to go for sub-2 hour Dudes on a Map game it's hard to imagine choosing this over Nexus Ops. Everything here is so transient and opportunistic; my favorite DoaM games are both opportunistic and have some kind of long-term progression. Here, it's really just your three stats which is a little underwhelming.

Totally happy to play this again, but will not be rushing out to get my own copy."

Running around and fighting is kind of fun, but the bonuses from the cards are where all of the points are scored, and that seems just disconnected from everything. This is not a game I want to keep track of the multiple special actions cards 4 other players have to be able to act accordingly. The getting a boat destroyed card is so easy to fulfill and worth so much for example. Thematically, way too many bonuses for dying for me. "

The Valhalla strategy (kill off your own people) seems very powerful with a huge spread of points by the end. Might be more enjoyable once players become familiar with the cards. The miniatures, whilst pretty, don't help you calculate strength quickly and it's difficult to keep track of everyone else's tableau / rule exceptions."

763,Chris Freiberg,7,"Area control masquerading as dudes on a map! I really liked Chaos in the Old World and I also like this. Sneaking around trying to get secret missions fulfilled for points is fun. The card draft seems like a pretty neat way to get around the knowledge hurdle that CitOW had of players needing to be really familiar with every faction's capabilities and deck to be able to effectively counter them. Instead inexperienced players get to see what their opponents can do before it hits them. (OK, so I guess Midgard came first and had card drafting before CitOW came out. Still a good idea.)"

I've had a few close games, but most games end up with one player pulling way far ahead.   One strong suite is the amount of guessing what your opponents are going to do and then outmanuevering them, while they're trying to outmanuever you. Bold actions are met with big rewards or utter defeat.  It's fun foiling people's plans!"

After one play, I definitely like it. Our group decided it is part Chaos in the Old World and part Kemet. I own both of those games, so I'm not sure I need to own this one, but I'd happily play this anytime. 

Draft cards, spend action points to deploy units to the board or upgrade abilities... gain VPs for generating battles or triggering certain special abilities. It's a Euro game in an Ameritrash skin (much like CitOW), it plays slick, and it was a lot of fun."
784,ciggie,6,"I played this more to see what the hype was all about as I really have no interest in this kind of game and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The minis except for maybe the large monsters do nothing for me, but that's not surprising. I'd rather have a hunk of wood with a sticker in my color or even the KS bonus ram heads for everything, than everyone having the same tiny brown pieces because all I look at is the base to figure out who is who. I'll never understand why people throw money at minis, but getting back on point I actually found myself liking this game in spite of my opinion of the lackluster playing pieces. The drafting is neat and the potential card combos are crazy, which really makes the game intriguing to me. My only wish was there was more variability in the cards between rounds as opposed to simply increasing point value for the same card. I guess even that just allows for combos too, but they are not as exciting. Overall the game ran a little long for me, but I can see it being faster with repeated plays and I might actually consider giving it another go, which I would not have thought before playing."

Territory control allows you to beef up your stats and gain points, card drafting allows you to set up your round-by-round strategy, and the action point system constricts what you are able to do each round as well as forcing you to consider when to do certain actions. Few things are as satisfying as planning a turn just right so as to get territories for free because you spent your actions well and locked other players out. Great game.

Furthermore, the card combos seem a little obvious and uninspired. Very same-y feeling from game to game."
840,coralsaw,7,"This is a lovely area control plus special abilities game, a solid design and a great mix of Euro and American style gaming. Unfortunately, it does not compare to its predecessor, CitoW in as much as depth of gameplay and player interaction is concerned. A good game that I'd be happy to play whenever it hits the table.


+ Solid main mechanism and action set, elegant yet functional gameplay
+ Interesting battle mechanism, and due to the battle cards tense and satisfying (although I prefer the dice a la CitoW which give it an epic feeling)
+ Easy to teach
+ Great minis, art and components

= Requires knowledge of the decks to avoid surprises
= Requires people to actively hate draft to stop almost game-breaking combos
= Long with 4 players, but enjoyable so that's fine
= Lacks the brilliant asymmetry of CitoW

- Disliked the (usually unavoidable) ""I occupy the whole province and you cannot plunder or invade"", too static
- Some upgrade cards, in the German version, had obvious Errata
- The quests seemed repetitive and unimaginative
- Last, one big boo for the Kickstarter exclusives, gameplay is less fun without them, so boo to CMON!"

I like this about as much as ""Rising Sun,"" which is to say it's one of the better ""dudes on a map"" game I've played. This isn't one of my particular favorite genres, however, so my passion for this game won't be huge. Still, it's good. There are multiple paths to victory, some of them not even requiring you to win many (or any) battles. For someone like me who is ALWAYS losing battles, that's a plus.

The board does get busy with all the minis scattered about. One thing that particularly annoyed me was that I could never tell what kind of mini my opponent had placed or how powerful it was. I'm sure I'd memorize that kind of thing in time, but it makes for a difficult first game.

Again, though, very solid. I'd play it again if invited to play. Not sure I'd bust out my own copy, though."

862,craigetcooper,9,"Fast, furious and fun. Off-the-scale production values with the best board game minis ever produced. But underneath it's actually a great game - it moves fast and there is always something to think about.

The viking theme really comes through with the various incentives to battle - either to defeat your opponents for glory or to lose to your opponents and go to Valhalla for, well, more glory. But even with all the bloody raging around the board it is still a game about strategy and clever point scoring and card play. 

And those minis...did I mention the minis?"
863,Crash8HM,N/A,"So I haven't fully explored the game, but I can say that the 2 player option is severely broken. The second the the balance slides to one side it stays there pretty hard.

+ Diceless combat system. you draft the best ""dice"" for combat.

+ Losing is an path to winning. Know when you are going to lose? Then draft cards where you actual earn points for losing. Changes how other players interact with you.

+ Smaller board per a round. Makes the game more climactic in the end.

+ One action per a turn. Gives players a chance to react to what you are doing instead of huge long turns that they can't react to.

+  Combat is based on what actions you interact with, not where you are at. Combat isn't when two players enter the same region.  You have to think IF you want to interact with players.

+  Non adjacent movement. Players can move anywhere on the board. Makes movement way more simple."

890,cschrad1,9,Seems to be the much streamlined and improved Chaos in the Old world. Card drafting from age to age giving each round an opportunity to develop a unique strategy for each round. helps to eliminate fixed strategies and OP complaints of particular characters as seen in CitOW.

Twice we had to call the game after the 2nd round due to a player gaining 100+ pt lead from their drafted combo. I can see this becoming less of an issue if all players know the distribution and abilities of all cards in each age that isn't a fun problem to solve (also probably why I generally dislike drafting games). The overall gameplay isn't that enthralling to have me wanting to play that much either."

Great drafting game/area control.  Played/learned this game from Sam Healey from Dice Tower!  I love how there are so many different paths to victory.  One could win by sacrificing your warriors every round by sending them to Valhalla...assuming you have the cards that give you those bonuses.  And the miniatures are absolutely beautiful...so much detail.

930,Damdael,7,I've now played about ten bouts of this game. I like it but it's not in my top ten of best games ever. The artwork is pretty and the figures nice. The drafting mechanism is fun and let's you decide whether to pick the best card for you or to prevent your next opponent in line from getting a superb card for him. What I've noticed is that it's typical for this game that one or two players get superb clan upgrade combos and finish the game with say 100% more points than the other players.
931,Damianknight303,10,Excelente Juego!!!
932,Damion Schubert,7,"A good game!  I don't think I'd put it above Lang's ""Chaos in the Old World"", but it's a tight, claustrophobic territorial control game with a strong Viking theme."
933,Damlog,9,"This was like a shot of gaming Viagra. My blood was pumping in places I had nearly forgotten about. I was getting bored by the same theme and mechanics presented in typical euro fare. 

Then this comes along and infuses some really cool minis and a  nordic mythology theme and simply rocked my boat.

But Loki how I hate the Loki strategy! My first game saw me maxing out on all the stats thinking I was doing everything just perfectly. And then losing to my youngest brother ,because he was gaining glory killing off his own guys with lots of glorious deaths. 

Well thats how we get to valhalla apperantly and thats how you can win the game.Lesson learned I guess.

It feels like a combat game, and it is, but not really.

I think at its heart its really a card drafting game. Everything you do hinges on what cards you draft, and how your opponents counter you is mostly determined by the same draft. It is thr biggest and best mechanic of the game.

That being said, it is so similar to Chaos that it makes it seem like it is a rip off and hard to appreciate on it's own merits...

Still, it's a solid game, happy to play it and would prefer it to chaos at 3 players.

1013,deathbystrawberry,N/A,Card drafting. Lots of fancy minis. Custmizable skills. Victory in battle is not required. Some area control.
1014,Deathhammer66,8,"A fairly light area-control ""dudes on a map"" game. Rules are simple and straightforward. It's a very pleasant and accessible game. All is built upon drafting mechanic, which determines possible strategies. It works very well and encourages creating powerful combos. Nearly all of them seem overpowered at first, but they're all like that, so game balances itself automatically. There are many ways of gaining victory points - even by losing battles. Personally, I don't like camping in one province, taking all the possible spots(because they are limited) and spamming multiple quest cards. Of course it demands some skill to create such a situation but feels just lame and emotionless. The difference between scoring for won battles and fulfilling the quests is sometimes so big that it's not even worth to fight others.

It is said much about the quality of miniatures and it's not without a reason. They are beautiful and full of details. Of course they bump a price, it's obvious. Sure, it could be played with tokens or meeples. But that's the aspect that grabs so much and I see no problem with that. The rest of the components is okay, pretty standard I'd say. Nothing particularly outstanding. 

So why Blood Rage is such a big success? Probably thanks to it's accessiblity, coherent mechanics that all flow together very well, trendy theme(vikings are quite popular recently, aren't they?) and... lots of plastic put into the box. The game brings nothing new, but it plays so smoothly that it deserves a 8 from me.

So you never know for sure if you will win a battle, and if you do, whether a Loki card will counter it because the other player didn't really want to win. Or if someone will accidentally spoil your plans because they have a similar card. Everything I did felt like a crapshoot. A big disapointment.

The game looks a lot more complex that it really is. There are only 5 actions you can take each turn, some costing rage from your pool this round. Combat is done using cards and the highest value wins. You can play cards to give you bonuses each round, provide upgrades to your units or add additional units. With 2 new players, it should only take 15-20 minutes to explain almost all the rules. 

The board constantly gets tighter and peaceful coexistence becomes impossible. The beginning of the game felt very solitare to build up your stats and creatures. When the board becomes tight, it's just a mindless slugfest. In one round, I basically ran full steam into the center of the map and managed to pillage it and eliminate a player's entire clan for that round.

It can be fun with 3-4 players willing to not take the game too seriously and just having fun. The fifth player leads to too much downtime. Players who try to optimize everything also tend to drag down the draft or turns and make the game just a painful event."

Voorbereiding:

Elke speler kiest een clan en clansheet. Neem de clan’s leider figuur en 8 warrior figuren en plaats ze in de plastic basissen in jouw kleur. Neem je corresponderend schip figuur. Plaats je figuren in je reserve op je clansheet.

Plaats alle monsters naast het bord.

Zet je clan’s glory marker op de 0 van de glory track.

Plaats je clan tokens op de juiste plaats op je clansheet: 6 rage, 3 axes & 4 horns. Plaats je laatste clantoken op de 6e plek van de rage track. 

Plaats de valhalla sheet en de age track sheet naast het speelbord.

Plaats de pillage tokens met de groene rand in de provincie Yggdrasil in het midden van het bord, met de beloning faceup. Schud de andere pillage tokens en plaats ze random faceup op de 8 overblijvende provincies rond Yggdrasil.

Schud de 8 ragnarok tokens en plaats er 1 op elk van de 3 ragnarok plaatsen van de age track, met de tekst faceup.

Plaats het doom token op de provincie die overeenstemt met de provincie die op het ragnarok token van de first age track staat.

Afhankelijk van het aantal spelers, neem x aantal ragnarok tokens en plaats ze met de vernietigde zijde naar boven op de juiste provincies.

5 spelers: geen vernietigde provincies
4 spelers: 1 provincie vernietigd
3 spelers: 2 provincies vernietigd
2 spelers: 3 provincies vernietigd

Een provincie met een ragnarok token is onbestaand. Hierop kunnen geen figuren worden geplaatst.

Sorteer de kaarten op hun rugzijde en maak 3 decks: 1, 2 en 3. 

5 spelers: voeg de 5+ kaarten toe
4 spelers: verwijder geen kaarten
3 spelers: verwijder alle 4+ kaarten
2 spelers: verwijder alle 3+ en 4+ kaarten.

Plaats het saga token op de eerste plek van de first age op de story track.

Geef de startspeler het startspelertoken. Dit token schuift op het einde van elke age door naar de linkse speler.

Elke provincie (gebied) heeft 3 tot 5 dorpen. In elk dorp kan 1 figuur staan. In Yggdrasil kunnen oneindig veel figuren staan.

Er zijn 4 fjorden, telkens tussen twee provincies aan de buitenrand. Elke fjord ondersteunt de 2 provincies die hieraan grenzen. Elk effect dat de provincie beïnvloedt, zal ook de ondersteunende fjord beïnvloeden. In elk fjord kunnen oneindig veel schepen staan.

Speelbeurt:

Het spel duurt 3 ages. Elke age bestaat uit 6 fasen. Verplaats de saga token op de age track. Wanneer de laatste fase van een age is afgelopen, verplaats je de saga token naar de eerste fase van de volgende age tot het spel eindigt aan het einde van de derde age.

1/ God’s gifts:

Geef elke speler 8 kaarten. Elke speler kiest een kaart en geeft de overige kaarten aan de linkse speler. Herhaal dit tot elke speler 6 kaarten heeft. Leg de 2 overgebleven kaarten af.

Spel met 2 spelers: kies steeds 2 kaarten tot elke speler 6 kaarten heeft. Leg de 2 overgebleven kaarten af.

Kaarten van vorige ages worden bewaard op de clansheet.

2/ Acties:

Tijdens je beurt kies je 1 enkele actie. Als je actie rage kost, betaal je de kost door het token op je rage track te verplaatsen. Als je niet voldoende rage hebt om te betalen voor een actie, dan kan je die actie niet meer doen. Als je rage op 0 staat, dan kan je geen enkele actie meer doen (zelfs geen gratis acties).

De actiefase eindigt meteen wanneer alle spelers op 0 rage staan of als alle provincies zijn gepillaged.

A/ Invade:

Kies een figuur uit je reserve en betaal evenveel rage als de STR van de figuur. Plaats de figuur op een leeg dorp in om het even welke buitenprovincie (niet Yggdrasil). Een schip moet in een fjord worden geplaatst.

Invading met je leider kost geen rage!

Als je evenveel figuren op het speelbord hebt staan als het getal op je Horns stat, dan mag je geen figuren meer in het spel brengen.

B/ March:

Betaal 1 rage en kies 1 provincie (geen fjord). Verplaats om het even hoeveel figuren van 1 provincie naar lege dorpen in 1 andere provincie. De provincies hoeven niet aangrenzend te zijn. 

C/ Upgrade:

Je clansheet heeft plaats voor 8 upgrades: 
1 voor elke warrior, leider en schip
2 voor monsters
3 voor je clan

Kies een upgrade kaart uit je hand en betaal evenveel rage als de STR van je kaart. Plaats de kaart op de juiste plek op je clan sheet. Als er geen plaats meer is, leg je de oude kaart af en vervang je ze door de nieuwe kaart.

Troop upgrades: Wanneer je een leider, warrior of schip opwaardeert en je hebt het corresponderende figuur in je reserve, dan mag je deze figuur meteen in het spel brengen (invade) zonder rage te betalen.

Monster upgrades: Wanneer je een monster opwaardeert, neem je het corresponderende figuur en plaats je jouw basiskleur eronder. Daarna mag je het monster figuur meteen in het spel brengen (invade) zonder rage te betalen.

D/ Quest:

Speel een quest kaart facedown op je clan sheet. Dit kost geen rage. Je mag zoveel quests spelen als je wil, zolang je rage niet op 0 staat.

E/ Pillage:

Kies een provincie waar minstens 1 van je figuren instaat (of in een ondersteunende fjord) en die deze rond nog niet succesvol is gepillaged. (pillage token toont de beloning side up). 

Pillage kost geen rage. 

Pillage bestaat uit 3 stappen.

Stap 1: kondig het gevecht aan.

Elke andere speler (van links naar rechts) kan ervoor kiezen om in het gevecht te stappen door 1 of meer van hun figuren van een aangrenzende provincie te verplaatsen naar een leeg dorp van de betreffende provincie. Dit kost geen rage. Schepen kunnen niet verplaatsen. In Yggdrasil kunnen oneindig veel figuren worden geplaatst.

Wanneer er geen vijandelijke figuren in de provincie staan of er zijn geen ondersteunende fjords van andere spelers, dan vindt er geen gevecht plaats. Je neemt de beloning en draait de pillage token naar zijn pillaged zijde. In dit geval verdien je geen glorie door het gevecht te winnen.

Stap 2: speel kaarten.

Elke speler speelt tezelfdertijd 1 kaart uit zijn hand:

Je toont een rode Battle kaart: de +STR bonus wordt toegevoegd aan de totale STR van al je figuren die deelnemen aan het gevecht + alle speciale eigenschappen op de kaart hebben effect.

Je toont een zwarte upgrade of een groene quest kaart: het voegt geen STR toe en het heeft geen effect.

Stap 3: de speler met de meeste STR wint het gevecht.

Bij gelijkspel verliezen alle spelers. 

De winnaar van het gevecht verliest al zijn uitgespeelde kaarten. De verliezer van het gevecht mag al zijn uitgespeelde kaarten terug op handen nemen. 

Alle verliezende spelers moeten al hun figuren in die provincie vernietigen (inclusief de ondersteunende fjords) en verplaatsen naar de Valhalla sheet.

Enkel de speler die de pillage heeft gestart, maakt kans op de beloning van het pillage token (draai het token daarna naar de pillaged zijde). Als de speler die de pillage heeft gestart, verliest, dan blijft de pillage beloning liggen. 

De winnaar van het gevecht wint sowieso glorie gelijk aan hun axes stat, ongeacht of hij de pillage heeft gestart of niet.

3/ De spelers mogen 1 kaart houden voor de volgende age en leggen alle andere handkaarten af. In de derde age moeten alle handkaarten worden afgelegd.

4/ Questfase:

Elke speler draait al zijn quest kaarten om. Als de voorwaarden op je kaart zijn voldaan, dan verdien je glorie (zie questkaart) en mag je 1 van je stats met 1 stap verhogen.

5/ Ragnarok:

Vernietig de verdoemde provincie en vernietig alle figuren in de provincie en de ondersteunende fjords. Deze figuren en fjords gaan naar valhalla. Ontvang het aantal glorie dat op de age track staat voor elke figuur die werd vernietigd. Verplaats het doomtoken naar de volgende verdoemde provincie. 

6/ Bevrijd Valhalla:

Alle figuren van valhalla gaan terug naar de reserves van de betreffende spelers. 

Het einde van een age:

Draai alle pillage tokens terug naar de zijde met de beloning. Geef de startspelertoken door naar de linkse speler. Verplaats het sage token naar de eerste fase van de volgende age.

Het spel eindigt aan het einde van age 3.

Voor elke clan stat dat op de 4e of 5e stap staat, verdien je +10 glorie. Voor elke clan stat dat op de laatste stap staat, verdien je +20 glorie.

De speler met de meeste glorie wint!"

But wow, I think this game seriously overrated. Overall, I found the gameplay somewhat average, with point scoring multipliers in Age 3 playing a huge role in determining the winner, not to mention the overly deterministic combat.

Bummed that there hasn't been any other expansions(beyond the initial ones) to shake things up a little. Still an awesome game, and the drafting changes the game from play to play, but overall it can start feel samey as I thought might happen. Drops a few spots, but remains as one of my favorites.

[January 2016 - 9.2]
This game is well worth all the praise it's getting as it hits all the right notes. There's strategy, but the game isn't complicated or difficult to teach. There's minimal downtime as you could be involved in every turn. There's great interaction, but you don't lose the game from losing one or even a couple of battles -- in fact losing battles may be your strategy. And of course, the miniatures and artwork are fantastic.

There's area control, timing, engine building, drafting, battles and bluffing. It reminds me of a mix between Cosmic Encounter and El Grande with hints of Seven Wonders and Hansa Teutonica. 

Drafting is definitely key, and one thing our group has learned is to definitely be aware of what people's strategies are -- especially going into the third round -- and then make sure to take some of the cards they want before they get to them. If you combine a few key cards together from a group, then it can lead to 100+ points in the third round.

There are quite a few over-powerful cards, especially if grouped correctly, so stop opponents via 'hate drafting,' or be sure to build your own powerful group of cards that can match them in points.

That being said, my question with this game is how much legs does it have? There might be the potential to grow tired of the same cards -- as many repeat themselves in rounds 1,2 and 3 (only with different points) -- or does getting to know every card really well just make the game better as you play on?

My guess is that there will many, many expansions that come out to vary the game, although that may start to disrupt some of the balances, especially if one faction (style of play) gets under-represented and another over-represented.

For now, it sits as one of my top-rated games and we'll see how long that lasts."

When my ameritrash loving gaming buddies made me play Blood Rage, I thought: ""Oh no, not another Dudes on a Map game!"". A few rounds in, I had to revise my first impression. While Blood Rage looks like your typical ameritrash game thanks to all the miniatures and the setting, the gameplay itself surprised both me and my bloodthirsty gaming buddies. In the draft, I made my clan worship Loki and therefore I made a lot of points just losing battles and fulfilling Valhalla quest while the other guys played a more conventional dudes on a map game. My attempt to try something different worked out in the end. While everyone was struggling with the sudden end of a round, which triggers when either all regions have been pillaged or no one has any rage left and reminded me a little bit of Luna, I just made sure I did the two or three things I had to do and let my people die in battles afterwards. Surpringsly, this worked and I won by quite a margin.

All in all, in my one and only game of Blood Rage so far, it felt a lot more like a Euro than your typical ameritrash game."

Card drafting -- that balances combat modifiers with unit upgrades and scoring bonuses -- instead of dice brings surprisingly strategic depth to the game, and good design decisions deal with the 'just kill everything' mentality and 'pick off the loser of the previous battle' issues common to most DoaM titles. Possibly the best DOAM game yet. (January 2016)"

1106,doldilocks,8,"I go back and forth on how I feel about drafting in Blood Rage, but I always like playing it. The only thing I wish was different was the fixed round system. I vastly prefer games which let players dictate the tempo of the game as much as possible. Doing this to BR in particular would require a massive upheaval in card design and resource numbers. But as presented, I like it a lot. Probably won't ever own it, since it's a game that already has multiple copies floating around in my group.

I haven't been too keen on any of the expansions I've played with. They don't add much, which both makes them easy to integrate and teach, but also makes them forgettable and nonessential to me. It isn't a case like with 7 Wonders Duel Pantheon, which is a small expansion, but does a lot to recontextualize what is already there. Blood Rage expansions are mostly hot sauce to me. I'm not always in the mood for them, but every now and then I'll add some or too much and it will be a nice change of pace."

1110,domcrap,8,"Blood Rage is a euro-style area control game where the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of three rounds. There are a ton of different ways to get victory points just like a traditional victory point salad euro game.  The mechanics are nicely balanced and elegant, but they do not make much thematic sense. In these regards, Blood Rage is a very well done euro game.  

But Blood Rage also has the direct conflict of an traditional ameritrash game.  It comes with over produced miniatures of amazing quality that make you want to love the game.  And the game play delivers in spades.  While many of the mechanics don't make any logical sense, the theme comes through emotionally by making you feel like you're in the midst of a chaotic battle.

It's a bit not so good in 2 player mode as it becomes a bit of action, follow, action, follow, etc to prevent free pillage. Also winning yggdrasil battles is a bit unbalanced as you will probably be able to pillage again for free as the first action of the new era.

I got mine for £52 but I've seen versions in other languages as expensive as 75€ or more, that's overpriced in my opinion.

1129,Dr Locrian,9,"Blood rage is an area control game with a twist, in fact there may be several twists. The game is just as much as about drafting, and strategic card play than it is about having the most men on the board and you can even win by having your pieces killed in battle or in Ragnarok .

Overall I like the game, though I feel I prefer Chaos in the Old World (CiTOW) to this one quite a bit.
 
Firstly some Postives:

Short set up time and relatively quick play time.

This game actually plays well with two - which is a massive plus in my book.

Great minis, perhaps the best I have seen in a board game outside of Games workshop, and with no - or minimal - assembly.  There is no need to paint these minis as the plastic already has a little bit of colour (it's like someone fell into the molten plastic) a pinkish tinge and the monsters are a bluey grey colour. They make the models in CiTOW seem like tiddly-winks.
 
Customisable sides, leads to asymmetric powers, and I feel the game would hold up to repeated plays.

Dynamic play, with the board state constantly fluctuating.

The fact that you can have a death orientated strategy via Loki cards is brilliant. Though this information is apparent to other players as upgrades are placed onto your player mat. 

Neutrals:

Board is functional and nice, but not beautiful (that's probably not the right word) I feel its utility reflects criticisms of CiTOW's board for being busily artful, without enough pragmatic considerations, like can you actually fit the miniatures onto the boardspace?
 
The scores aren't as close as I would like so far, and I have some concerns regarding things being 'overpowered', but I'll take it on trust that that is not the case, and it's more a situation of needing familiarity with the cards, which makes your first game(s) a little opaque. Can you choose cards in fitting with any strategy and play well and win irrespective of which strategy you choose? I don't know.
Compared to the board I feel personally that the miniatures are overproduced, they seem to suggest another game which this one is not....

Cons:

What I mean to say is that the game has this steroidal almost mad viking theme, which is lots of fun, but actually it is a thinky and euroesque game more than a 'war' game- I like this fact - but this degree of separation makes the theme seem a bit disconnected.  And the minis increase the price-point a lot. Wooden tokens would have worked just as well and would have mitigated the feeling that I never feel like I am pillaging anything on the board or 'marching', or that my monster - as cool as it is - is actually more than just a number I bring into 'battle' and then manipulate with my  annoyingly small cards. CiTOW also has annoying small cards - it's worth saying that in both games both are small for equally good reason. However I do feel that whatever happens on the board in that game is more thematic - and just a gamer-y if that is what you want. Hence I'd recommend that one over this.


Addendum: I think this is better with 2 than most people give it credit for. Swingy scores with groups of mixed ability/ knowledge of the cards. The wide spectrum of score might be a strength of the game though."

1144,drbobjack,3,"1 demo play, with two rules incorrect (we played that the winner of the battle gets the reward regardless of who initiates the pillage, and without an initial province destroyed) so take it with a grain of salt.

Viewed as a thematic game, it very much limits the range of conflict and drama that can actually occur. Very few pieces in each location, all powers are relatively incremental (with exceptions like the giant that kills everyone at his location.) It's a curious choice for what should be The Ultimate in Theme.

As a strategic game, the card-drafting multiple-path-to-victory doesn't really appeal to me. The connections are fairly obvious (if you get all the points-for-dead-stuff upgrades and the kill-your-own-stuff, you will probably win.) A mix of cards seems a good idea; you don't even have the pleasure of very diverse strategic paths, as would ideally be the case.

I feel it's a hybrid design that takes the worse elements of thematic games (lack of depth, special powers on cards) and strategic (multiple paths to victory, surprisingly low interaction, combo engine pieces)."

Tension comes from the ambiguous meaning of unit placement, racing for resources, the uncertainty of card play in battle, hidden quests, and the risk of loss in battle. Battles are a three-stage auction with several wrinkles, and actually created some interesting moments. I'd play it again, although I wish the game was half as long.

The production detracts from the enjoyment for me: I'd much rather it have simpler pieces, and employ a theme that wasn't so obviously targeted at men who think that blood and death and monsters and objectified women somehow make a game more immersive."

It turned out it was good choice for [b]Cool Mini or Not[/b] to employ established game designer because [b]Eric Lang[/b] made one great game. And CMON made some amazing miniatures of course. You pick your tribe and everything have the same starting parameters, but then cards are being drafted and your race sheets are being upgraded with unique powers, abilities and allies. And then you pillage Yggdrasil and surrounding lands for blood, glory and Ragnarok. And it plays like that in three rounds. It's fairly quick epic game, leaning slightly, but really slightly toward thematic Euro, which I love.

1185,Duke_Pedro,10,This is the best game ever!! Simply love it!
1186,DuneTiger,7.5,"As Chaos in the Old World is one of my favoritest games, I was happy to learn that Lang decided to revisit it on his way to designing Blood Rage.  I was less than thrilled to learn that he was working with CMON, but it worked out pretty well (and admittedly, the minis are cool).

Like CitOW, Blood Rage is an area-control game with a little asymmetry thrown into the mix that is, unlike CitOW, somewhat customizable.  While each faction has a starting base power, you can tailor your faction to your liking so long as you can afford to get the upgrades you want.  This ensures that despite the game starting the same each time you play, there's a good chance that as it goes on, you'll find something different at least through several playthroughs before it gets old.

One of the neat ideas that gets explored here is purposely sacrificing your units to get bonuses.  At first, I thought this might be crippling, but it isn't.  It's pretty easy to get your guys back on the board so it's all the more fun to throw them into certain death just to squeeze some more points out of the deal.

Another thing that distinguishes it from its grandpappy is the card drafting.  Where in CitOW, each player has their own specialized deck to work with, in Blood Rage, everyone shares the card pool and must draft what they want to have for the round.  One of our players coined a nice phrase called, ""hate drafting,"" which turned out to be quite the effective strategy.

On the downside, it seems the three tracks with a potential 60-point swing seems a bit overpowered.  Yes, you can fight against it, but clever play will inevitably end up with someone getting maxed out on the three tracks and if you haven't been paying attention to them, you have no hope of winning.  The other thing I felt lacking was that despite the minis being absolutely beautiful, they drive the price of the game to a ridiculous amount and YMMV, really.

Is BR better than CitOW?  No.  I find that CitOW is a finely-balanced asymmetric game, perhaps the main reason I find it to be one of my favoritesty games.  But that doesn't mean that BR is a slouch - far from it, there is merit to owning both.  While they share similar ideas, they feel distinct from one another, and we even tested that by playing them very closely to one another.

If I may use an analogy, CitOW is a finely-tuned, balanced and powerful GTI where Blood Rage is the little Fiesta ST that is rough around the edges, but still a lot of fun to drive."

The only way all the players can have enough fun is to have them knowing perfectly the game and the existing cards in the game for the deck building, so they can anticipate what can happens. There are some cards that can completely ruins the game of one opponent, even at its very first turn, letting him with absolutely NO way to recover for the remaining turns.
This is not how I imagine a good and well-balanced game.
Of course there are many games where experienced players would win a bit more easily over newcomers, but when the game is well designed, even beginners have their chance and different ways to handle issues.

1205,earthtone,8,"Brilliant.   The game is fairly easy to teach, and the theme and mechanics are mashed together exquisitely. You constantly have to watch what others are doing, weaving your clan onto and around the board in order to find the best scoring opportunities that line up with the cards you drafted.  It's a big sweaty muscle dance.  

I feel like it's a game that you have to play a lot to really start reaping the joy out of it.   The more you and those you play the game with know the cards, the craftier you'll have to get.  It can be kind of tough on new players, because they don't know the cards.  Some of those monster powers can be perceived as jerky if you don't know it's out there.

The one thing I don't like about the game is that winning can feel kind of dirty.  The game revolves around a secret hand of cards that you use to manipulate and mess with everyone else.  Many times, I've felt that the best player in Blood Rage best exploited poor decisions made by the other players, and while that's the case in most games, in Blood Rage it kind of feels mean due to how cards function.  

You can undo a players whole round by throwing down a monster that destroys everything they've built up.  You can lock up a territory (which experienced players probably wouldn't let happen) and exploit it for quest points and stat bonuses, and watch while everyone else decimates each other, and then roll out with a clean up crew - it comes back to everyone needing to have a play or two under their belt (which, admittedly, is not a lot for a decent strategy board game) to level the playing field.  

Unfortunately, I just don't have the mix of players to play this game enough, and for some reason I have a tough time asking someone to play a game called Blood Rage.   My fault.  Not the game.

Despite only giving it an 8, I think it's one of the better, and more engaging games I've played in a long time."

1225,Eeeville,7,"Blood Rage looks like an ameritrash game... it has 'amazeball miniatures,' a viking theme, and looks like a dudes on a map game. Upon closer inspection, it is really more of Euro game or at least a hybrid (ie Kemet). For example, you're trying to get the most Glory/VP to win the game through an action point system. Unlike most action point games, you won't necessarily use all of your action points before the end of the round and there are ways to upgrade the number of action points you receive at the beginning of the round. I like that all of the factions start symmetrical and differentiate as the game goes on through a wonderful drafting mechanism. It's also great that it's hard to pick on someone... when you start a combat, everyone in the region participates. This game plays quickly, is easy to teach, offers interesting decisions, and looks good as well. Definitely worth checking out, even if the theme/chrome turns you off.

I don't like a sea of grey unpainted miniatures, so I use standees for monsters and meeples for player units:

The other thing I like very much is that you can also win by losing battles and dying. So this is not a typical area control fighting game. There are lots of interesting aspects in it. Also I like that action point allowance system is used for action phase. Very similar to Tikal, for this part =D 

The flip side is that there seems to be some quite overpowered cards that should always be just hate-drafted away if you couldn't use them by yourself or you'd most probably lose to some more experienced player because you let those cards go. 

I like the viking mythology theme. Miniatures look neat, but overall, graphical looks of other game components seem to a bit outdated to my eye. They are ok for playing so not bad, just some more effort should have been put on these to make them look more awesome."

1236,ekloff,8,"Blood Rage addresses essentially every complaint I have with combat heavy games (peaceful observer strategies, swingy dice combat resolution, player elimination, bash the leader, etc), and it does so without opening other holes for players to exploit. Each decision is multifaceted and gives players enough to chew on to stay engaged and focused, but without slowing the game. The constant cage match-style battling leads to some very memorable moments, and the game has an epic air from start to finish. The fluidity of the board-state, and various victory paths facilitate flexible play from round to round, which is quite unique considering the genre, but I still have concerns regarding long-term replayability."

Comment:
A great, fast strategy game with a strong theme.
Eric M. Lang did a very good job designing a cool mix of card-drafting and area control with several tricks.
Adrian Smith's illustrations are gorgeous as always, but sadly the general layout doesn't support them in the way it should.
The miniatures are fantastic and the general production quality is brilliant.

One of the best strategy games I've played in a while: 8 out of 10!

Update #1: Raised my rating to 8.5"

1248,EliasH,7,"I only wish i had the kickstarter exclusives. Leaves me with the feeling of not having a complete game.
Still fun to play, but lacks a proper catch up mechanic. Misplayes in age 1 can leave you out of the game."
1249,Elicaryn,5,"Tbh, this game felt a bit repetitive and bland. After the first Ragnarök, there really is not much to encourage the player to go on with two more turns. You go in, you pillage and if other players decide not to intervene, it turns kinda into a point-and-click game but on a board. 

Card designs, on the other hand, are good and they are putting *some* spice into an otherwise bland experience. Also, choosing a clan should've had balanced benefits and shortcomings other than having different models - at this point, it is no different than choosing some colours.

The art style of Blood Rage is its strongest suit imo, puts you into that Vikingy atmosphere. 

All in all, Blood Rage is a good game to play with friends at board game cafes and conventions if you exhausted all your primary options but not a must-have for your collection."
1250,Eliian,7.5,"It's a lot of fun, and it's fluid and fast-moving. The card draft is kinda weird in that it seems to incentivise personal strategy rather than conflict. Which causes some strategies to be better than others. This is even more true if someone feeds into a loki strategy. A cause for too much of a requirement for hate drafting. Which is not our preferred style. Also, not really a negative but everyone needs to be engaged in the game or it takes way too long. But it's still very fun, tightly tuned with many paths to victory without bashing the leader."

1255,eli_snow,9.5,"Heavy metal viking clans warring for glory throughout the three Ages leading up to Ragnorak... what's not to love?! In action, Blood Rage is a game that delivers on its ever intensifying story-line. Its elegant artwork, map and miniatures emit an epic vibe that only further propel this narrative theme to glory. From the card drafting and hand management to the area control and the action point allowance--the combined mechanics provide a system of play that causes every option in every turn to feel like an equally enticing path to victory without diminishing in the least the importance each choice offers. Yes, the gifts of the gods are outrageously swingy. Yes, throwing the battle to visit Valhalla in death is a sufficient path to victory. And yes, Loki the God of mischief is a powerful force that all must mutually reckon with. While none of this is what you would expect at first glance, it is exactly what you didn't know you needed. High in theme, conflict, and crunchy mechanics; low in luck and clock-time. In my book, 'Blood Rage' has synergized the very best of Ameritrash with the very best of Euros in the very best of ways.  Side Note: The distasteful sexualization of women throughout IS a disappointment. Highest Marks: Epic Moments and Upsets, Tough Card Drafting Choices, Intricate Miniatures."

I have played countless 2 player games and they are usually well decided, which is removed somewhat at higher player counts. 

The true beauty of the game is the draft- because you want all of the cards. Everything has a use to you and the opponent, and you have to ask what you are willing to sacrifice, and pay attention to what your opponents are doing. "

Here there's much more of an emphasis on timing and ordering of actions (given that combat/pillaging can be called at any time, rather than just at the end of the round). Of course, the draft is a huge component of Blood Rage as well, whereas selecting upgrade cards in CitOW was quite rote. As for drawbacks:  the third (final) round of Blood Rage is one of massive scoring potential, greatly overshadowing the prior two, unlike CitOW in which every round mattered. Also, the necessity of keeping other players in check is much reduced; here you're out for yourself, first and foremost."

Except for those two aspects, I really enjoy it.

EDIT: I had not a very good experience the third time I played it. I now see the disadvantages of some of the battle cards, which could be very destroying and frustrating. A player can build up to a really great battle, putting all efforts in, and then be destroyed by one mean battle card. Next time I play it, I will take the most destroying cards out of the game, and see how that affects the game play and strategies."

The main meat  of the game is the card draft however there are far too few cards to give any variability really as all but 2 cards are in each draft pool. There is also no way to stop a combo of cards once it is in play, this can lead to a win more situation. 

I would much prefer to play seasons for the card draft as there is SO much more variability in the card powers and they ways they interact not only with your board but with what cards everyone else had drafted. This card interaction in blood rage is severely lacking, card-combos usually consist of only two cards.  Age 2 and 3 cards are also significantly better than age 1 cards.

The area control/ board movement aspect feels a little tacked on and the theme really does not show through. In champions of midgard it feels like I am vikings going on epic quests, or defending my village. In blood rage they really could have been anything milling round the board picking fights.  Also thematically why would the frost giants ever be on your side? 

The minis are receiving of a lot of praise but honestly they could have been tokens, and the sculpts are nice, but they are pretty much industry standard,or at least CMON standard, nothing special nothing raising the bar. 

I can see the comparisons between this and chaos in the old world and IMO Chaos is significantly the better game as a lot of the mechanics from chaos have been streamlined to the point of near obsoleteness in Blood rage

1355,Fausticus1,2,"Tried to give this game a chance multiple times but I just can't see why it is so high in the rankings. Every time we play there is a runaway leader problem. 

If you do well in the first round, you will have better stats than the other players and more units left on the map. Which will almost ensure you will also have a good second round and so on.

I also think it is pretty strange that each area has a maximum number of units it can hold. This means you can swarm the map with cheap units and no one will be able to attack you. 

The mission cards are very lack-luster. Almost all of them just require you to control an area of a certain color at the end of the turn. A little variation with different missions would have been nice. It is too easy to see when someone is going for a mission.

The miniatures of course are great and the abilities on the cards are all pretty awesome, but with all the problems mentioned above I just can't enjoy this game."
1356,fayth,9,"Pretty easy game to learn and very intuitive once you play a round in the game. Card drafting might be the most challenging aspect of the game since you do not know all the cards in the game when you first play and the power creep of cards in the later rounds. There are complaints of overpowered card combinations but in card drafting games, this is always a possibility. Multiple ways of winning the game and the Viking theme and mythology is integrated into the game very well. Very good mix of area control, combat, and card drafting. The different faction in the game all start out the same and differentiate with card drafting and stat gaining from successful pillaging. Very cool miniatures and artwork in the game and highly enjoyed playing the game."

1359,felherc,10,"Amazing! Deeply strategic and tense. I love how in each game a completely different strategy might call to you: read the signs, go with the flow, and you might end up with a killer combo... or find your plans ruined by someone else. Victory is never guaranteed and you always have to deal with uncertainty. Luck might be on your side or not, but I think it will rarely feel unfair: you will lose mainly to your rivals' maneuvers, not so much to bad luck.

And the theme! Aside from the overly sexualized female warriors of the Serpent Clan, Blood Rage really shines with its enthralling world and ambience. The minis are awesome, with details that surpass FFG quality. Try playing while listening to symphonic or death metal (people would likely believe you if you said Therion's ""Secret of the Runes"" album was the game's official soundtrack ;))."

Une variation de draft combo all-in vahala rigolote la 1ere fois mais répétitive. Un équilibre plus que douteux ... Une énorme déception et la confirmation que je haïs les jeux de draft.
1372,Ficiani,9.3,"An amazing Euro, area-control, dudes-on-a-map game. The combat is great, very rewarding and happens very often and most of the time is inevitable.
I love the card drafting option as it makes every game different with millions of possibilities in your hand and decreases the luck factor to almost zero.
There are multiple strategies that are encouraged by the game and as such, the game offers a high replayability. Our group wanted to immediately start a new game as soon as we completed the first one.
This is my 3rd favorite board game (after Scythe and Rising Sun) and the rating is 9 simply because of the underwhelming expansions that the game has. The expansions are nice but nothing spectacular. If you bought the game and don't want to spend more money for expansions, that's totally fine as expansions don't change the game by much and the game is best played with 4 - the default player count without expansion - there is an expansion for 5 players as well."

1383,Finstar,7,"Good Game - But definitely overhyped.

The game is VERY swingy, even for veterans, which makes it quite unpredictable what is going to happen in the mid and end game. A lot of secret information (who got which cards?) along with the design for a lot of confrontation with several players at once lead to a certain lack of control for the players and a randomness of who is eventually going to win - No matter how skilled the players are. 

Also, it does not feel like you fight other players in a wiking battle. Instead, it feels more like you acommodate against a current situation on the board.

Verdict after six plays with four players: Great game, outstanding art and production values - but surely not the best game of 2015."

Vannak azért hátrányok is: kicsit kevés féle kártya van, túl sok az ismétlődés. Három party után úgy érzem, hogy nem igazán éri meg győzelemért harcolni, mindig hatékonyabb az véráldozat, ami azért nem teljesen tematikus nekem.

1388,fixie,N/A,Great game.
1389,fizzle,6,"An area majority game with decidedly Ameritrashy looks and a Euro character. The heart of the game is the card draft at the beginning of each age which sets the overall direction of what you are going to try to achieve this turn and how you might go about it. Depending on how that turns out losing battles can be just as helpful as winning them, and scoring opportunities abound, with the later rounds dwarfing the early slim pickings. Card knowledge is quite important throughout as many of the cards are almost ridiculously powerful and can easily smash a carefully groomed plan to tiny pieces."

1402,Flundi,7,"Blutrausch. Frakturschrift. Das martialische Cover mit dem Wikinger, der aus blutroten Himmel auf uns zustürmt. Monster aus dem Höllenschlund. Miniaturen. Rasende Wut. Das ganze Auftreten schreit Ameritrash in seinem Urgebrüll. Doch was so barbarisch erscheint ist nur die krachende Verpackung für ein verkapptes Eurogame mit Entwicklungsleisten. Okay, da gibt es das Kampf- und Streitelement mit Walhalla, Ragnarök und nordmythologischer Heldenehre, aber im Grunde ist BLOOD RAGE ein Majority Game klassischer Spielart, angetrieben durch Card Drafting jeweils zu Beginn der drei Spielrunden mit immer kleiner werdender Spielfläche. BLOOD RAGE ist nicht einmal besonders schwer, spätestens in Runde 2 nimmt das Spiel Konturen an. Und als Mehrheitenspiel ist BLOOD RAGE sogar recht fluffig: kein Brainburner wie mancher Euro-Kollege, wenngleich man seine Rundenidee schon planen und durchdenken sollte. Der grösste Verdienst scheint mir, dass es BLOOD RAGE als Formal-Hybrid gelingt die Schubladen von Eurogamer und Ameritrasher gleichermassen zu sprengen. Insofern hat dann doch der Hammer des Thor zugeschlagen."
1403,Fluttershy31,9,"The more I get into gaming, the more wary I get of games that get a lot of hype. This one has lived up to its hype for me and my group. Has that perfect weight that appeals to most of my gaming circle. Strategic enough for the heavy gamers, light enough for the casual gamers. In and out in about an hour or so. So much fun!! I tend to be more of a euro gamer myself, but this didnt feel so competitive that it would be off putting. It was all just in good fun. Easy to roll play it up if you wanted to. One of the few games I have picked up lately where I played back to back. I might of been late to the party on this one, but so glad I bit the bullet and picked it up finally. 100% worth it.

Edit 1/20: This is easly one of our most played games. its easy to get to the table for a couple of reasons. The game does not over stay its welcome....an hour/hour and a half, and youre done. Its relatively easy to teach, and the rules seem to stick in peoples brains after just one play. That said I have to lower my rating from a 10 to a 9...not a huge drop....But my main gripe is that certain strategies are just easier to grasp. Loki is for sure the easiest, and to be honest its the one I tend to use because I am not an aggressive player...and by sitting back I might not win, but I can at least be respectable. I tend to play with folks who are into mega battles all the time, which i guess is the point, but Its just not my typical style. Im more of a dry euro kind of gal! haha....I love how tight the game is, such a clean design, it doesnt need expansions. We bought Gods and quite honestly It left me cold. I just like it plain and clean. some say simple, I say clean. Nothing wrong with that! I can see why this game isnt for everyone. It barely is for me, but it does scratch a certain itch. I still recommend this game for people who want to start expanding their collections."

1435,freechinanow,8,"Finally another game in the ""Chaos in the Old World"" camp from Eric Lang that does area control, card drafting, and battles in such a nice way.  First off, my favourite part of gameplay is the ability to take a ""losing"" strategy where the glory of entering Valhalla upon death could be worth big points given certain card combos.  It feels like a very fresh alternative to some other battle games.  The card drafting doesn't so much dictate your turn but gives you options for how you may want to play out your turn and what you want to focus on.  Balancing these cards is important as well as plans may change as you react to other player actions.  CitOW was all about getting a set faction and exploring its possibilities.  Blood Rage allows you to customize your faction through card play, which is excellent.  The different Monsters you can call on are also supremely awesome- not just their miniatures (which are some of the best) but the way they bring up some amped-up power to the game is really cool.  Blood Rage was a little much at times for my poor, puny Euro brain to handle.  There really is no ""catch-up"" mechanisms.  This means that players must watch each other and prevent each other from pursuing their primary goals too much.  This means some hate-drafting or counter-drafting needs to take place if only to prevent someone else from taking it.  But I don't consider this a fault of the game- it merely sets the tone for a style of game that can definitely be frustrating and painful to those who can't stand to be crushed before their enemies, lamentations, etc. Fans of area control, American-style battle games, and card drafting really should check this one out! It can be punishing and very opaque to new players, but it is a clean, very fluid design. "

Despite all its coolness I don't think I'd buy it.  After one play through I just don't see enough replayability here.  Perhaps the game is best with more than 2 players.

1482,galaxybear,8.5,"So, it's not really a dude on a map / area control game.  It's a worker placement game, thank about it!  But it's a really good and fun worker-placement/engine building game and I really enjoy what the card draft adds to combat.  The theme really works well.  The game has a really good length and a nice weight for what it is

 The more I play it the more I like it, but it suffers at lower play counts.

Also, there is a huge advantage if one player knows the cards better than anyone else or a huge disadvantage if one player simply knows the cards the least.

This would be a really great game for a game group to pick up and then always and only play together as the meta-game would be the most interesting that way.

It's also a completely different game with KS exclusives, much more random.  I think I like it without the exclusives better though..."

1493,Gamer_Dog,5,"Somewhat preliminary rating after 3 plays.

There are a number of moving parts with the area control, special card powers, quests, and drafting. Not sure it's a satisfying game though as there isn't a ton of variety in the cards, and engine-building seems to take a back seat to tactical play. 

As for the production, the minis are definitely nice. Not a fan of the player boards, or some of the artwork. As a card game, you'd have to sleeve the cards to keep them from getting worn quickly. I can't see buying a game this expensive based on the overall game play, but there seems to be a market for this sort of hyped, thematic kickstarter game."

1499,GamingCoupleGA,6.5,"I thought this game would convert me to AT.   Unfortunately it did not.

Cards are imbalanced.   The leaders should be 2 not 3 so they are also overpowered.   I also don't enjoy the chaotic nature of the game.   Strategies are based on how many people feel like fighting you in that moment and you have little or no control over what can happen.

Mini's and components, except the small cards,  are really nice though."

1510,garyh1964,9,Vikings!!! Area control. Best minis  I've ever seen. Amazing!!!
1511,Garyoh,9,This is my favorite board game from 2015.
1512,gashlycrumb,8,"Is this game a spiritual successor to Chaos in the Old World or Midgard? It has a different feel from both. In CitOW, your race determines your strategy, whereas in BR you have to adapt a bit, depending on what cards come your way. Also, there are no dice. I also like the bluff element with the Loki cards. The minis are highly detailed and the monsters are crazy good. Happy that some of the KS exclusives actually add to the game and are not useless. As for Midgard, well, it was more of a straight-forward area control game with card drafting. It's a fun game, but it certainly lacks the theme that Blood Rage has. I see no reason to own Midgard, but I can see owning BR and CitOW."
1513,GattoNero25,8,KS
1514,gattz,8.5,Sweet miniatures and theming. The gameplay is easy to grasp and teach and the game itself is probably the perfect length. They really tightened up the design for this area control card drafter...even compared to Chaos in the Old World. (Which I might like a tad more.)
1515,gavhuds,10,"The miniatures in this game are amazing and really help bring the theme to life. Despite an epic instruction book the game is actually very simple. Though I was probably halfway through the second age on a first play before I had any real strategy. If I had one criticism it's that the first round is a little hampered by the low rage setting, which would be ok if the game wasn't only 3 rounds long. It's a fantastic game with some tough decisions though, particularly in the drafting where you know you might be taking a good card, but handing a card to your opponent that cancels it out.

My tip; monsters look cool, but they are costly to keep putting out."

1525,geki,8.75,"This was the game that made me like an area control experience. The reason being, obviously, that is not really about area control. While a solid presence on the board can be visually satisfying and point rewarding via quests and battles, the variety of other scoring opportunities (special combat cards, Loki-losing-battles-for-stuff abilities, ragnarok positional strategy and the like) combined with the inherent challenges of drafting makes for a tense, relevant gameplay experience that is unbelievably quick paced (in that every turn takes a moment and every battle is potentially open to every player)."

1541,GGJeeF,8.9,"From a legit name and design to a great style of play that's what Blood Rage is. Blood Rage comes in with wonderful designed minis which arise from the viking mythology. Starting with a card drafting system, then you place your brave warriors trying to gain the most glory during three rounds. There are many ways to gather points by sacraficing your own folk to Ragnarök or by simply conquer your enemies. The mechanism is super easy but give a lot of place for strategy and tactical maneuvers. The theme is also caught fully by this masterpiece.
Actually I cannot tell what exactly makes me rate this ""only"" 8.9 points but one little minus is the inlay you get with the original box. This is really a game where you should think about buying a new inlay. Not only to pretend your items from any damage but also to make it easier to setup all these things.
Unfortunately, I missed the kickstarter. This is a game where I really would have love to have all kickstarter pledges.

I'm back with tons more plays. It's a staple for the group. Something that shut up and sit down (favorite review group) pointed out is it seems more focused on the cards than anything else. And I'm okay with that! Makes it easier to pick up and learn. 

I haven't played with the expansion yet, but seems like a good addition.

Some tips: Don't pass to many loki cards! If someone goes loki they will win! Grab one or two, you'll most likely get a chance to use them. 

Also do not be afraid to change tactics after an age. Sometimes your cards will point you to a better strat.

Time passed: This is still a good game, but its starting to feel limited. Like I wish there was a bit more intelligent plays. I mean their is, but alot of it is heavily placed on the drafting. I guess I want a bit more from combat?"

1608,Gotuso,6,"Played it thrice, each time the game felt a bit disappoing. My main problem is that stalling seems to be a really effective and boring strategy. Committing to the board, trying to plunder and win a lot of fights on the other hand felt like a terrible idea. Especially in act II there are a handful of cards that can really punish this strategy. The 'wait-and-do-nothing' plan on the other hand is much harder to disrupt because that player gets to act last. 

So far scores in Bloodrage have not been remotely close and personally I don't feel a need to try and get better at the game to become competitive. "

Great use of the nordic mythology, it's clear that their priorities are much different because dying isn't necessarily a big punishment like in most games. Sometimes that's exactly what you want to do.

Plus, these are the best looking and most detailed miniatures I've ever seen! Every 10 minutes someone walked past our table and said ""WHOA!"""

1620,grasa_total,5,"Was a lot better when played with correct rules. On the other hand, combat has some of the ""I don't even get to play"" problem common to blind-bid games; I probably favor using Loki cards to profit from losing battles a little too much just because otherwise I hate losing.

And spending a bunch of rage on a monster that doesn't really pan out is disappointing in the same way.

On the other hand, it's basically a Michael Schacht game, updated with modern gaming contrivances and ridiculous miniatures."
1621,Graycross,7,"Taken me a while to sit down and rate this, and I'm kind of hesitant about where it's at. The game feels good, I'm a huge fan of how well everything comes together: A very seamless integration of a relatively unique set of mechanics (Drafting, Area Control, Tableau-esque). But, it doesn't feel great, and I have some ideas as to why.

[b]Pacing:[/b] The game says 60-90 minutes, I don't know if I've ever hit that. I see how it could get there with more practice such that drafting and card abilities become more familiar but it took nearly four hours when I took it out for the 4th play (After a long break between plays).
[b]Identity Crisis[/b] Now I don't generally think this is a bad thing, and it's nice to have a wide variety of viable strategies. But the game tends to have very little going on strategically, in that your initial strategic choice tends to be meaningless. Your choices end up being very reactive (tactical) based on drafting, and change drastically age-age with little carry over except for a very small set of Clan upgrades. I think that this degree of disjointedness bothers me because it flip flops strategy and tactics more frequently than I would like.

1623,greamejohnston,8,"7 Wonders meets Chaos in the Old World in Kemet.  I wouldn't describe myself as an Eric Lang fanboy but I will never pass up an opportunity to try one of his designs.  Drafting is a great balancing mechanic and the card 'families' in Blood Rage offer players the chance to create some strategic lines to guide play.  Board play may seems chaotic to the uninitiated and... stay awake, or some denizen from Hell will appear in your province and obliterate your clan, and your chances of victory.  Yet you do have fragments of information about what dangers might lurk in the clammy hands of your opponents and what they might be up to- enabling you to foil their evil plans-mwah,ha,ha,ha.  Player interactivity is on the medium-high side so you are rarely unengaged.  It also scales really well.  I would choose Kemet over Blood Rage with 5 players.  However, Blood Rage will hit the table more often because the 3 and 4 player game is just as satisfying as the full bhuna.  Oh, it looks great too."
1624,Great Raldo,8.5,"This game has a lot going for it.  Cool miniatures, lots of fighting and conflict and a lot of different ways to go about winning.  It's rare to see a run away leader but sometimes you do get a player left behind a little bit, although mostly you do have a chance to make up a lot of territory in the 3rd age of the game.  From the same makers as Chaos in the old World, and you can see the similarities in the way figures are placed on the board and actions are limited.  Personally I think Chaos in the Old World is superior, but I think Blood Rage is a bit simply and has more mass appeal."
1625,Great Raldo,8.3,"A really fun game with a great theme and some amazing figures.  The difficulty and tension ramps up nicely throughout the game and it's possible for players to make late come-backs and win from a long way behind.

The main drawback is the drafting system.  This gives a big advantage to experienced players of the game, who will know good combinations of cards and what to look out for.  Also the cards are unbalanced, with some being much more powerful than others, and each of the 3 ages in the game can be made much easier if you get the right cards.  The last age in particular has one card that helps gain a huge amount of victory points for very little effort and the winner of the last 4 games I've played used this card.

With a bit better balancing of the cards this would be an even higher rated game."

I do feel the Loki cards, if hoarded by one player to the point of critical mass, can seem a little too strong.  During the drafting, this should be considered. It can be painful to let a good pick pass in favor of denying an opponent yet another card for their strategy.  Just keep in mind that ""winning the game"" is part of your strategy, and not letting the opponent win is still in alignment with your master plan. 

...that's what I tell people who complain when I hoard the Loki cards."

Overall gives a very unique and good feeling wile playing. My concern is that I was the runaway leader and pretty much dominated as round 2 was midway through.

It does the job well enough to set up your engine, but it leads to necessary ""hate drafting"" in later rounds. I prefer Kemet's style of engine building where everything is a positive interaction. What I love about Blood Rage, through, is the power activation. Each turn players can be active as long as they wish, as long as they are managing their power. With only three rounds, this creates a nice tension that is both self controlled and heavily pushed by opponents. It is more difficult to teach than Lang's Chaos in the Old World, but also a little smoother to play. Blood Rage does a good job with its interactions. It keeps players feeling able to compete even after they suffered from an unsuccessful sweeping move. There is a lot to like here. A few to many ""check-up"" phases in-between turns and I don't think drafting adds much to the game but an engaging game nonetheless."

1659,Grunt778083,9,"This game you could call sort of the spiritual successor to Chaos in the Old World. There are definitely similarities between the two games and it becomes very obvious soon, that it comes from the same designer. Just that Blood Rage has much more impressive miniatures and the gameplay seems a bit more fluent and especially balanced.

Why not a 10?
Blood Rage is, apart from the miniatures, missing really deep and wonderful design. The board looks a little bit boring compared with Chaos in the Old World. Also the cards and side boards (Valhalla, Clan Boards) are not that beautifully designed. Still they are good, but missing the little extra.
From a gaming point of view Blood Rage has only little issues.
For example two clans, of course hating each other like hell, are standing there with some units in one and the same country, they cannot fight against each other, if that country has already been pillaged in this age. This is really sort of strange to me. I mean this is like two clans running towards each other, roaring out their Viking Rage and then just stop saying “Oh… The country has already been pillaged… No, no… Then I’m not gonna cut your head off. Let’s start a fire and have a BBQ.”. This just feels wrong.

Player Count:
It goes very well with 3 or 4 players. I haven’t played it with 2, but have to admit, that I don’t think that would be really interesting and would also face some additional issues.

Recommendation:
Yes, it is better than Chaos in the Old World! Even if you got Chaos at home, give this one a shot, it’s worth it.

Who should not buy it:
People who don’t like Viking mythology, Fans of colorful and happy games

1663,gschulte,6.5,Got to play this on the BGG@sea cruise 2017. was impressed at how fluid the game was. I have been disappointed in a few other CMON games so came in with low expectations and was greeted with a light rules but great depth game. you can go with what your cards give or try to hold to a strategy and both can pay out in the end. Great game and worth picking up
1664,gskillman,9,I lost and enjoyed this game. That's a good sign.
1665,GSReis,8,"An interesting evolution of ""Midgard"", keeping the card draft and some of the area majority scoring, but much more focused on combat. I sometimes wish ""Blood Rage"" was more similar to its predecessor, just with far superior components and artwork, but this is just because I'm more of a Euro gamer. It is more like a Euro-Ameritrash hybrid, but it does well what it intends to do and may please fans of both genres.

The draft that starts each of the three rounds is full of agonizing decisions, as most cards feel overpowered (in a good way) and you don't want to give them to your opponents. Then you play upgrades and deploy troops or monsters that will eventually have to fight to pillage regions. The diceless combat is quick and simple, which is a good thing.

Interestingly, I found a bit of similarity to ""Cthulhu Wars"" in the way that you spend rage to perform actions and how your clan gains different skills as the game progresses. But ""Blood Rage"" doesn't have big swings of power and doesn't rely on ganging up on the leader to keep the game balanced. In fact, the dynamics of the game make it very hard to gang up on any one player.

The only real flaw is that the central region, Yggdrasil, may be too important. It increases all your three stats if you successfully pillage it, while other regions increase only one. And since troops that lose a battle are destroyed, it's not uncommon for a player to hold it for the entire game (and most often win).

The miniatures are fantastic, even though I would have preferred the vikings to be in the player colors, instead of identified only by a colored band put around the base. This should have been a solution just for the monsters. Nonetheless, the miniatures really enrich the experience and I probably would rate the game lower if it didn't have them."

In principle, yes, drafting should take care of concerns about card balance--but I'm not sure there's much room for hate-drafting in this game. In a game like Fairy Tale, where you will only play 60% of your cards, you could easily hate-draft. But in Blood Rage, you can easily play all of your cards each era, which encourages everyone just maximizing your own strategy's score. If that's true, then I worry that some strategies are vastly superior to others--compare the points for dead dudes vs. ship upgrades, for example.
But it's still very fun and it seems to win friends wherever it goes.

Its strategies, while seemingly complex and divergent at first blush, are obvious, its minis underutilized, its board relatively uninteresting, and it has a tendency to feature a runaway leader. In this case, that leader was me. I don't speak from the perspective of sour grapes.

While it is, moment to moment, good fun and theoretically expansive enough, it's ultimately an area control game that has its priorities misaligned and waylaid by cardplay. Those first ten minutes of drafting basically supercede the entire area control aspect. Kemet and Siege of Columbia did a better job of balancing power/engine acquisition and ""dudes on a map.""

I used to hate drafting. I've since made peace with it and accept it as seasoning (ex: Steampunk Rally), but not as the main course. I'll play this, but there are better options."

The minis are so cool, and (despite there being a decent number of bits) it's not very fiddly."
1736,HeavyAdge,10,Combines arguably my two favourite game mechanics in area control and drafting. Game is played over 3 ages and offers varying strategies for victory. The diverse cards can create really cool engines if combined in different ways. The Gods and Mystics expansions are both nice additions. My only qualm would be playing the game at 5 is a tad chaotic.

1741,heikman,7,"Sure this is a straight euro that disguises as an ameritrash game but its chrome & awesome theme is pretty convincing.
Basically an area control game, with many ways to individualize your struggle for most VP. You can go for brute force, specialisation, numerical superiority, sneaky tactics, or a mix of it.
The game is very tactical because the board is ever changing, so thinking on your feet is more important than any long term strategy.

I wouldn't play this with five again, as it was way too long for my taste. But with three or maybe four this could easily replace games like Kemet or to a certain degree Dogs of War.

Quick, shiny, viking romp.

Update: Yeah 4 is much better than 5! (as usual)

1755,Herc162,6.5,I know many people love this game but it really fell short for me. The interesting options just weren't there. The cards were limited and the drafting was just OK. There indeed is a runaway leader problem and strategy options can feel weak. I guess playing this a lot with the same people could fix most of theese problems because people will start drafting in order to prevent some of the overpowered strategies (i.e. Loki cards) but this is not the kind of game that appeals to me.

AUFWERTUNGEN

Friggs Beistand (I) und Dunkelelf (II)

Frage: Wenn ich die Clan-Aufrüstung Friggs Beistand im Spiel habe und mit dem Dunkelelf Yggdrasil invadiere, darf ich dann auch dorthin mit 1 Krieger zusätzlich ohne Kosten invadieren? Denn Krieger können Yggdrasil ja nicht invadieren. Außerdem: Kostet es 1 Wut mit dem Dunkelelf Yggdrasil zu invadieren oder 3 Wut, da seine Stärke dort ja 3 beträgt.
Antwort: Der Dunkelelf kostet immer nur 1 Wut, wenn er invadiert, auch nach Yggdrasil. Friggs Beistand erlaubt es auch, 1 Krieger mit nach Yggdrasil zu nehmen, wenn der Dunkelelf dorthin invadiert.

Friggs Beistand (I) und Schiffe

Frage: Wenn ich die Clan-Aufrüstung Friggs Beistand im Spiel habe und mit einem Schiff invadiere, darf ich auch dann mit 1 Krieger zusätzlich ohne Kosten invadieren? Wenn ja, wohin?
Antwort: Ja, diese Aufrüstung gilt für jedwede Invasion, auch für Schiffe. In diesem Fall darf der zusätzliche Krieger in eines der beiden Gebiete gestellt werden, die angrenzend zu dem Fjord sind, den das Schiff invadiert hat.

  Friggs Schutz (II)

Frage: Friggs Schutz sagt: „Du darfst 1 Wut bezahlen, um zu verhindern, das 1 deiner Spielfiguren getötet wird.“ Darf man das mehrfach machen, vorausgesetzt man kann die Wut bezahlen?
Antwort: Ja, man kann beliebig viele eigene Spielfiguren retten, solange man für jede gerettete Spielfigur 1 Wut bezahlt.

Völva (III)

Frage: Die Völva kann sich nach Yggdrasil zurückziehen, anstatt getötet zu werden. Was passiert, wenn die Schlacht in Yggdrasil stattfindet?
Antwort: In diesem Fall wird die Völva getötet, da sie sich nicht dorthin zurückziehen kann, wo sie sich bereits befindet.

Zwergenhäuptling (I) und Soldat aus Hel (III)

Frage: Die beiden Karten kosten keine Wut, um sie ins Spiel zu bringen? Antwort: Beide Karten kosten weder beim Aufrüsten noch beim Invadieren Wut.
Faktisch kosten sie also niemals Wut.

KAMPFKARTEN

Friggs Gunst (I)

Frage: Die Karte sagt, dass ich einen weiteren (anderen) meiner Clan-Werte ebenfalls um 1 Stufe erhöhen darf [erste Auflage] bzw. dass ich zusätzlich einen Clan-Wert
um 1 Stufe erhöhen darf (falls möglich, nicht den bereits erhöhten) [zweite Auflage]. Was passiert, wenn ich diese Karte beim Plündern von Yggdrasil nutze oder wenn ich durch das Plündern 5 Ruhm erhalte?
Antwort: In beiden Fällen darfst du einen beliebigen Clan-Wert erhöhen. Bei allen anderen Belohnungen musst du aber einen anderen Clan-Wert erhöhen als den, den du durch das Plünderungsplättchen erhalten hast.

Heimdalls Sicht (I) und Tyrs Herrschaft (I)

Frage: Heimdalls Sicht sagt: „Diese Karte hat denselben ST-Wert wie die höchste gegnerische Karte.“ Tyrs Herrschaft sagt: „Deckst du in einer Schlacht eine Aufgabenkarte auf, darfst du sie als +3 Kampfkarte behandeln. Wie verhalten sich diese beiden Fähigkeiten zueinander?
Antwort: Wenn der Besitzer von Tyrs Herrschaft eine Aufgabenkarte aufdeckt und entscheidet, diese als +3 Kampfkarte zu nutzen, dann gilt auch Heimdalls Sicht als
+3 Kampfkarte, vorausgesetzt, die Aufgabenkarte hat dadurch den höchsten ST-Wert.

  Lokis Gift (III)

Frage: Wenn zwei Spieler Lokis Gift (möglich mit der Erweiterung für 5 Spieler) ausgespielt haben, wer erhält dann die Karte(n) vom Sieger?
Antwort: Beginnend mit dem plündernden Spieler erhält der erste Spieler in Spielreihenfolge die Karte(n). (Spielt also der plündernde Spieler eine solche Karte, erhält er ggf. Karte(n), ansonsten der gemäß Spielreihenfolge als nächster folgende Spieler.)

Lokis Gift (III) und Tyrs Tapferkeit (II)

Frage: Lokis Gift sagt: „Gehörst du zu den Verlierern, nimmst du alle Karten, die der Sieger ausgespielt hat, auf deine Hand.“ Tyrs Tapferkeit sagt: „Gewinnst du eine Schlacht, darfst du je 1 Wut bezahlen, um beliebig viele deiner ausgespielten Karten zu behalten.“ Welche der beiden Fähigkeiten hat Vorrang?
Antwort: Die Fähigkeit von Lokis Gift kann nicht durch Tyrs Tapferkeit verhindert werden. Tyrs Tapferkeit kann nur verhindern, dass ausgespielte Karten regulär abgeworfen werden.

Lokis List (I)

Frage: Wenn zwei Spieler Lokis List ausgespielt haben, wer erhält dann die Wut vom Sieger, falls dieser nur 1 Wut hat?
Antwort: Beginnend mit dem plündernden Spieler erhält der erste Spieler in Spielreihenfolge die Wut. (Spielt also der plündernde Spieler eine solche Karte, erhält er ggf. Wut, ansonsten der gemäß Spielreihenfolge als nächster folgende Spieler.)"
1788,Homp,4,"CMON's fetish for mass producing miniatures hides a fairly basic dudes on a map game anchored around 3 rounds of card drafting. strategies that emerge from the draft are mostly uninspiring, and make your options during the game largely random.

2) Simply incredible components.

This game looks and feels awesome.  It forces players to compete from the very beginning and ramps up very nicely.  It's easy to teach and still rewards experience.  "
1829,HypnoticSpecter,8.75,"I feel the game is very good, but not the most spectacular game ever in comparison to the hype it received. The miniatures for the game are everything, which Blood Rage has amazing ones, but the rest of the components leave a little to be desired. Small cards, and decent, but fairly thin player boards, but they get the job done.  The design on the board is functional, but a little drab for my tastes, still it looks good, and definitely better than anything I could design. 

The game itself is just fun at the end of the day. Eric Lang produced a solid area control game, with card drafting and hand management combat system. I'm always drawn to games that don't rely on just dice rolling to resolve combat, and this game does a really nice job with the system presented here. Plus there are many different strategies to take, that even if you are getting destroyed in encounters, you can go the Loki route, which wants you to sort of sacrifice your warriors for Glory(VP). A really good, and overall short play length, for this style of game, gets two thumbs up from me.

Sadly, I can't say the same for the expansions for Blood Rage, since they leave a lot to be desired. The ""expansions"" are basically slight modulations to the core rules, which barely put a dent into the game, as far as new mechanics are concerned. But because of this, it's not a bad idea to include them in someone's first play of it, Blood Rage is due for a nice big expansion that adds more to the game. Maybe new monsters to recruit, a new map, artifacts or sacred weapons players can get that alter their armies, or variable player powers. At this point, Eric Lang has assuredly moved on, from this project to work on more things, but man I hope he revisits this one again.

Now a Rant, not for the game per se, but CMON in general:
I'm not to keen on CMON's business model. Every big game they publish is kick-started almost always being over-funded, and I feel the people who don't fund get skimped on content, such as the inclusion of a 5th player, expansion that non-backers will never see, etc. They did this with Xenoshyft as well. But Blood Rage I think didn'tsuffer too badly, because almost all of the content can be purchased nowadays outside the KS, unlike Xenoshyft(legendary items and Heroes) and Zombicide Black Plague(literally everything it seems). I personally hate KS exclusives, but I understand having a few select things, like metal coins/components, thicker boards or wooden bits instead of cardboard, but taking out mini's or semi-expansion content should solely be a timed exclusive that becomes available later. Just saying the fear of FOMO is ever present in so many CMON games, please make these things less exclusive - how about exclusive molds, or varied artwork for KS backers, or limited edition box that can hold everything you went all in for. Meanwhile I need to fork out $100+ just for the Fenrir model and card, which is just uncool. Look I don't hate CMON by any means. The bring out some amazing  games and have designers who are very talented, but I feel the hype from their miniature-based games garner a ton of hype, and can inflate a game's cost down the line, the more ridiculous the miniatures become."

1843,icegubs,8.1,"I prefer it slightly over Kemet, although the two games are very similar in my head, mainly because of the Valhalla mechanics. Of course the miniatures are nice as well but I don't easily fall for this kind of stuff. "
1844,IceHot,10,"This is great game from Eric Lang that easily ranks in my personal Top 20.  There are nice elements of card drafting, well timed plays, combat, vp scoring, engine building, and area control.  The game is rich in theme and builds throughout with out losing players along the way as long as you play reasonably well.  The game does favor experience.  The only two small issues I have are with the expansion elements the mystics and Loki can both be problems when the players are of disjointed skill levels as the two elements can be more easily manipulated by experienced players to exploit situations that seem to stray from the core game."

1853,ihilate,9,"I love this game.  There are multiple routes to getting the VP needed to win, rewarding different strategies; the card drafting means that your strategy isn't scuppered by bad luck, so it's almost entirely skill-based; the fact that rewards escalate through the three ages of the game means that you're never left without a chance of winning, even if you do badly early on.  And and minis are probably the best quality I've seen in a board game.  Brilliant!"

1855,Ikaroed,8,"Bringing together two mechanics I love: card drafting and area control in a fantastic way, as well as combining combat and action points. All this within the Viking theme, with art and miniatures that are a separate spectacle.
The fact that you can choose such different strategies, even being able to completely change direction over the 3 ages and still have a competitive strategy, is the strong point of this game in my opinion.

1867,iMHqoMvhavyk,N/A,"By Eric Lang. 3p, 4p or 5? Expansion needed for 5p. A DOAM game with a draft-and-pass phase, card-based combat, bluffing and area control. Categorized as having simultaneous action selection because of the draft-and-pass phase, but the action selection occurs later and isn't simultaneous. Some people have said this is primarily a draft-and-pass game. The draft-and-pass phase causes players to know most of the cards that will be played, so I searched for complaints about a lack of surprises in Blood Rage, but I found no such complaints. In fact, some people who prefer Blood Rage over other DOAM games (e.g., Kemet) have said they prefer Blood Rage specifically because it has more surprises. If I were to play this with 3p, 4p or 5p, I would try using the 2p rule of drafting 2 cards at a time (/thread/1809584) because there would be more surprises, and I prioritize surprises over balance. There is moderate in-game text that must be read from small cards in hand and on the table. Tech Geek Gamers' first session (/video/138456) includes major rules mistakes. Board Crazy's session (/video/138782) and Tech Geek Gamers' second session (youtu.be/zgS1yLqVIkc) show gameplay that doesn't seem as exciting as some fans have claimed. Also, I doubt my gaming group would enjoy Blood Rage because we've disliked every draft-and-pass game we've played and some members of my group dislike reading text on small cards. I'd consider trying Blood Rage if it weren't so expensive."

1869,Immermnemion,7,"Played at a friend's house. Blood Rage - appropriate to the theme - forces a lot of rage, mostly due the result of near-constant combat. There is no true turtling here, and the rather limited number of components makes decisions necessarily precise and meaningful. Cards which can make or break battles are obtained through a drafting system, though the entropy this and the card uses add to the battles are a bit much for my taste in an hour-long game."

1878,Infernotez,1,"This is one of those games that completely turn me off. I played it once and I was ok with it, but then I played again and I made a misplay in the first age, I was thrust into last place because of that with no way to do anything to recover. 

The rage mechanic also(plus the fact people can steal rage) completely kills the game for me. It's supposed to be a constraint but it feels more like I'm getting locked into choices because of what can happen in any given age.

If you are new to this game it can be a miserable experience as anyone with experience has somewhat of a clue what to do and you might not notice how badly they are messing your plan up. In my first game I completely messed up a guys plan by not taking an action which cost him the game(he played optimally otherwise) but since I didn't fight he could not fight and his game was set back big time. It honestly feels worse than monopoly to me and that is my most hated game.

When you play with 4-5 people the game gets rather long and it makes me want to just play shorter games with similar player numbers.

I would much rather play games like Bunny Kingdom, Ethnos or 7 wonders which are similar"

The minis are wonderful and really add to the experience, not just in look but also in feel (placing them, moving them etc). Card drafting is really good fun, looking for combos too. I really like the fact that the system can incentivise losing battles too. AND we only played 2p which I understand is not the game at its best at all!

This game is highly refined, for example the amount of provinces available to pillage each game is spot on. And this game flows well it is quick, decisive and brutal.

1896,isaaclh37,9,"This game is great! Easy to set up and get on the table. Everybody I play with is enamored with this game. I like the Viking aspect and the mythological theme surrounding it as well. The combat is great and I like the Euro feel with the ""rage"" being your resource for actions. The minis are so cool and I love the monsters. Overall amazing game. Only gripe and why it is a nine is because some of the monsters are missing. The monsters I mean that are missing are the ones that came in the Kickstarter. Like why couldn't they include the Mtn giant that is second leader. Or the Mystic troll who has all your men count as two (combos with a warrior upgrade and other things). And ofc why not Fenrir, the dark wolf who has the ability to make any land he is standing on becomes destroyed at the end of an age and ignores the Ragnarok of the land with the ""fire"" token on it. and where is Hella? This should not discourage from buying the game, bite the bullet and buy this game. Great first game for gateway boardgamers."
1897,isfella33,6,I do like that this war-game allows for a player to have a winning strategy by losing battles.  Game play is quick too.  Great viking theme but it doesn't do it for me.  I never feel invested in the game.

It seems overhyped and so random. Drafting is the main mechanic and trying to remember which cards i have given to my right is painful. Cards always making great differences and mostly makes no sense.

Inis and Kemet is so much better than this game. I absolutely dont get the hype.

I really dont like that game but still i will give it another chance. May be i am missing something.

After few plays: You must play several times to love this game and you must learn cards too. When all players get equal experience on the game and cards, it becomes a marvellous game. Great area control. Easy to teach and learn, super thematic, many ways to win.

After few plays again: It is become repetitive, because of unstoppable combos of some cards and never used leader upgrade cards. It is easily accessible game but we must admit it is popular because of its super minis not mechanics.

However, I will never play this game again. It gets so many things wrong. Part of my dislike may be from thinking this game was area control going into it and being a big fan of area control and battle games. The area control element has no impact on if you win the game. The battle element has no impact on if you win the game.

This is a drafting game, that's it. You can lose every battle and win the game. You can control the board at the end of every round and lose the game. This has everyone who I have played with annoyed, even the winners. If you like card drafting and luck, this game is for you.

1954,javitxu83,8,"Game based on the nordic mythology were different tribes of vikings compete for being the most glorious one. I was very surprised when I first play this game. The owner was explaining the rules and I was thinking ""man, these rules are too easy. This game is going to be boring"" but, during the game, my interest started to grow as I find myself with several options every turn, and the things to do, were to put the minis, which card to play, what strategy to follow, and just with some very easy rules, the game came alive very smoothly and making a lot of sense. It is true that the mechanics could be applied to very different themes, there is not huge relationship between the vikings and what you do during the game but, however, it is fun to play and there is an adequate strategy and planning that has to be done in order to win.
And then, the great mechanic of the game, clearly, is the Ragnarok. When you first listen about the rule that after each era one location is going to be destroyed because of the Glorious Ragnarok, you think that better get off all my minis from that place, but when you realize that dying under that fireball is, in fact, a great way of earning points, it is when the fun starts.
One of the concerns that I have heard and experienced is that there are some special miniatures that break the balance of the game. I do not think that the differences are that big, but it is a point to be considered.
Positive:
1. Great artwork
2. Great miniatures
3. The Glorious Ragnarok

I also think it's helped by my rock bottom expectations going in, but I really enjoyed what I played and it seemed like the rest of the game would build on it nicely. When the first round was over I really wanted to keep playing to see the rest of the game.

The card drafting works well, in particular the hands are large enough and the player count is small enough that you'll see hands multiple times. I'm always happy with deterministic combat and it seems like you can do some cool stuff with well timed pillages in terms of moving people around. But I think my favorite thing was the customization and differentiation of the factions and the way that affects the way different players will play. I'd have really liked to see that through to the end to see how the different players developed and what kinds of power combos you could end up with. But already in the first round I was seeing some nice differentiation. I think my first reaction to it was to give it an 8, but between the components and just wanting to hedge a bit I'm going with a 7.5.

In the back of my mind I'm wondering if part of the reason I was as impressed with this game as I was is because it's not a genre I have much experience with. Recently all the new euros I play just feel like more of the same and that hurts their ratings, whereas Blood Rage feels fresh to me, but I can't really say in any qualified manner if it actually is doing anything particularly unique."

It can run a little slow at times, but even in the downtime the tension is off the charts. It also has some unique mechanics - chiefly that losing battles can be part of a valid approach.

It's not all to my liking, though. While there are some events one can plan around, the game is mostly a game of tactics, with only the board state and some upgrades - all of which may or may not be useful based on the cards one sees in the draft. Personally, I enjoy a bit more long-term planning. The game also shrinks the board as advanced tactics and powers appear. This might add tension, but it kills the ability to focus on building an engine - something else I like doing in games.

If this sounds like the kind of game you like, you are gonna love it. But even for those who usually don't enjoy this sort of game, it's worth playing."

Minis are very good quality for board game components.

The theme fits in very well as you're trying to earn the most glory as the end times approaches and cities are destroyed in its wake. Gain points for winning fights and even losing fights. Even the slain will bring you glory.

Expansions add a little bit of variety to the game but the only one I really think is almost required is the Mystics of Midgard. This adds the mystics which can displace one opponents non-unique units which adds a little extra strategy to deploying your warriors. The expansion is also very simple to add and adds more drafting variety."

Initial Rating: 4.0 (November 2015)

I wasn’t expecting much from Cool Mini or Not´s Blood Rage but still the game managed to disappoint me.

The rules are uber easy to grasp, the theme is cool except for the fact that you don´t feel you are a Viking fighting epic battles. Blood Rage is a control area game with some drafting between turns. For me the game fails miserably. 

First I have heard that the game offered “exquisitely” hard decisions in the drafting because all the cards were equally powerful but from my point of view that’s not true. The drafting is obvious in all regards, perhaps at the very beginning you don’t know what to do but after you have a couple of cards you need to pick the cards that complement your previous cards and game situation. It takes seconds to decide this because it is very obvious which card is the best one. I also feel there is a huge unbalance with the cards, for example the monsters can affect the game in a huge way (as the Orc in the first Age) and it is pure luck if you manage to draw one of the powerful ones, there is only one card per monster so it falls to the players to balance the game. To summarize I found the draft to be obvious and the cards to be unbalanced. Lots of uncontrollable luck here.

Second, the area control in Blood Rage fails for me as well because often, the loser of the combat wins almost as many points as the winner, it feels out of sync when a player does this, that is, it feels weird when a control area game allows and rewards a player when they lose control of an area. Besides purposefully losing battles doesn’t fit thematically in any combat game.

Blood Rage also features the (hated by me) “attack the perceived leader” and it lends itself to king-making situations. I heavily dislike both of this characteristics. In our game, it was a foregone conclusion who would win it even before the second age was finished, so it has a rich-gets-richer problem as well.

Blood Rage uses the same core mechanism that Chaos in the Old World (limited number of action points) from the same designer (Eric M. Lang), but the gameplay is a lot easier. When I play Blood Rage I feel I’m wasting my precious gaming time because the decision are too obvious, the game too shallow and its length way too much for what it offers (around 2 hours). I was expecting a heavier experience but the game is much lighter than I had hoped.

As is usual from Cool Mini or Not, the game components are amazing. The miniatures are unbelievable gorgeous and look great on the table. The art is very good as well and that’s the only positive I have to say about the game. Cool Mini or Not´s games usually follow this formula, they are gorgeous, incredible looking games, but sadly, they are also ultimately empty games. I’m clearly not their intended audience. I feel that if the game was regular looking it would not have the success it has today, that is, they put a lot of effort on the outside while the inside is very mediocre.
 
It is a very expensive game.

Bottom line, I know I´m on the very small minority, but I dislike Blood Rage. I feel the ONLY thing the game brings to the table are the marvelous miniatures, everything else fails for me. It has obvious decisions, it is a shallow and light game, its game duration is way too high for such a simple game, it has lots of uncontrollable luck. I would play Chaos in the Old World any day over Blood Rage. Way overrated, I already sold my copy.

2015,jgunnz,8.25,"Fun miniatures war game. Some degree of luck with card availability.  Great component quality. The monsters which special abilities are super fun to handle and deploy and the plastic ring system for sharing monsters in the pool is quite genius. 

Where blood rage shines is that players do not win simply based on succeeding in combat. Instead, players must strategically draft cards and plan their moves to manage their available resources (i.e. rage),to complete quests, and perhaps even lose in battle in order to gain glory points for being in or returning from Valhalla. 

There is luck element which is mostly (but not totally) mitigated by card drafting. For instance a monster upgrade is drawn and kept by the original player the chances of it being passed to the next player is quite low. Similarly, a player may not be able to get a quest card, or a high-numbered battle card, if those cards are retained by the original recipients of the cards.

Looks? Yeah, obviously. Interaction? In spades - you can't play your own game in isolation, you absolutely have to consider what the others will do as without a doubt it will affect you. Tension? Deciding which cards to pass on can be agonising, let alone which actions to take at which parts of your turn - timing is crucial. Euro-efficiency-mongering - getting the right card combos can be huge, allowing you to really fly. Fights? Oh yes, combat is not scarce or optional (see Scythe), and you had better know which fights to pick and which to avoid. Sneaky? - just check out the Loki cards, the opportunities for turning bad into good are immense.... Man, I love this game.

- Haven't played it with 2 players, but I do have the 5 player expansion. Recommend with 4-5 players. 3 can be king-makey, and I expect 2 will suffer from runaway leader.
- I love all the monsters and upgrades, but you have to balance these in the draft. I find this decision process really interesting... I really want this ability, but I know I'll be able to pull off this quest, and that battle card is awesome too... Decisions decisions.
- I also like the timing elements. When to push, when to plunder, etc. You want to do things in a particular order to be as efficient with your rage as possible, however you're often pressured to do things out of sequence to take advantage of an opportunity or prevent someone from throwing a spanner in your works."
2025,jimmymacattack,7,"This game is fun and exciting.  The theme is well-done in the art and mechanics and there are a few different strategies to play.  This game has a lot of really powerful actions players can take, and after 5-10 plays, I suspect there are a few cards a player nearly always wants to pick if they have the option.  On one hand, this makes the players feel powerful and the game more fun and exciting, on the other, it can lead to big swings and a little less importance for playing well all game.  Personally, while I appreciate Blood Rage and am definitely willing to play it again, I tend to like games that are more ""battles for inches"" instead of the ""battle for miles"" that is Blood Rage."

I was convinced that I would love this game from the first picture of the Fire Giant. After reading the rules I backed it, all in. I watched the campaign every day, I was excited as one can be for a game. 

Normally, for me, I usually back a game excited and by the time it shows up I've either cooled way off, or some series of terrible delays or terrible post campaign management sours me on the game.

Blood Rage had a few bumps and a tiny delay, but my excitement never wained. The day it arrived I was sitting on my porch like a loyal dog awaiting the return of their missing owner. The mail lady was completely irritated with me.

I didn't get to play the game until today, three annoying days after it arrived.

I'm thrilled to say my excitement wasn't wasted. :D

Sex sells, including on KS. This game is a hybrid ameritrash/euro with the balance scaled towards the 'trash' side. Over three rounds players hate-draft and play a cutthroat take-that area control game where chaos rules and outcomes are hard to predict. Go 'all-in' the first round, lose or get a draw and play a game of catch-up for the remaining time. Card combos are simplistic in nature with very strong take-that effects to make sure you can retaliate out of anger or do some serious leader bashing. Hence the games fitting name: blood rage!"

I'm not a fan of card drafting, card combos, special powers, or compounding abilities toward bigger badder moves. I find the game is largely about the draft and moving up the 3 tech tracks with the board as a stage for these things to play out. Early scoring is small and secondary to moving up the tracks and gaining upgrades toward bigger scoring opportunities in round 3. 

I'd suggest drafting/buying cards Dominion style (the game is essentially deck-building/hand mgt from age-to-age) but I doubt it would significantly alter my feelings. As it is, drafting prevents AP and downtime but at the cost of increased luck into a very significant part of the game.

I understand why it's popular: shiny bits, fantasy theme, euro point maximizer underneath; ultimately a familiar song with a new arrangement. It feels like 7 Wonders and Cosmic Encounter but played out on a board with Viking dudes. I bet the Dice Tower crowd is nuts for this. 

A funny aside, despite all the shiny chrome I never really felt the theme. Instead I found it easy to ignore in favor of maximizing points. But hey it's a euro with a lot of chrome. Neither good or bad."

The much ballyhooed minis and Frazetta-esque graphic sensibilities live up to their billing. Like a lot of drafting games, your progress up the learning curve is predicated on remembering what sorts of cards are available from round to round. Though not a gateway game in the usual sense, Blood Rage may be a good first step into the world of heavier, dudes-on-a-map strategy games for those who are curious about the genre."

Sure, it is a combat game, you expect to beat up on each other, but a few of the cards and the Loki strategy of winning by losing was too much. One remedy to defeating a predominant strategy when there is a draft is to draft some cards purely for blocking, which works, but is not satisfying for me. Also, I know we played a rule incorrectly that may have made the problem worse. I hope to play again to continue to formulate a final rating. I am sure that there are strategies to counter any of the cards that become apparent after more plays, so I am not saying that the Loki strategy/cards are over-powered; but it is an aspect of the game that is less satisfying for me."

As it turns out, card drafting was a large part of the game along with action selection: two of my favorite mechanics. Winning the game was not necessarily dependent on winning battles; there are several strategic paths to victory. That players can select their strategies based on game conditions made Blood Rage a very pleasant surprise.

The things that bothered me were king-making, perceived leader bashing, meta-gaming, rich-gets-richer, and excessive negative interaction. As a hybrid euro-ameritrash style game it is exceptional, but not my cup of tea :)

2103,Jorad,9,"After one play: Was a rough first game where I was pretty lost for the first two rounds but managed to score some points in the third round. Would love to play it more but was less enamoured with the drafting mechanism than I'd hoped. I do expect the enjoyment to increase in future plays.

Edit after a second play: Was doing much better, got the drafting a lot more, but was had my plans thwarted twice by events I didn't anticipate due to my inexperience. I was a little frustrated at the time but was immediately thinking of the next game after the game ended.

Edit after a third play: Ok, I love the game. The drafting really clicked this time, with me attempting to go for a Loki strategy but diverting to keeping as many dudes on the map as possible in the third age, leading to a really high (and winning) score. I also managed to stay out of trouble, not overextend and stick to my gameplan. Rating it a 9 for now."
2104,Jorage,8.5,"Card drafting works well to keep games from playing out too similarly, while presenting different strategies to pursue based on what's available to you each game. Confrontation is indirect with combat mechanisms allow space for some surprises, which makes it easier to stomach for those that aren't keen on it. The first and last viking game I'll need."

2111,jormungandr,7,"Much simpler than Chaos in the Old World. CitOW has a much more sophisticated set of interactions among powers and spells and requires players to be much more pro-active about checking one another when they surge for the victory. Blood Rage feels more like a conventional Euro in that players are most interested in building an engine to amass points for victory and strategizing from the draft how best to power their engine. Personally, I prefer CitOW (which has more ""story"" to it), but Blood Rage is a perfectly adequate substitute for those who want a more teachable and less violent theme.

As an aside, I would recommend letting new players know the possible variety of battle cards and having a reference card for the monsters (so no one gets an unfortunate surprise)."
2112,JoSch,7,I only played once with wrong rules but I liked what I saw and playing with the right rules won't change this although the rules mistake made my Loki-based strategy stronger. The central hand management and drafting for cards works perfectly and is so enjoyable that I even can enjoy the dudes-on-a-map fight for majorities as the other central element. The mechanisms and special skills intertwine smoothly and offer plentiful tactical choices whilst needing a strategic build of your clan. I would have preferred the game with cubes or standups instead of the miniatures but I'm an old curmudgeon.

Balance issues are significant enough that the draft mechanic isn't enough to counter the luck involved with getting the right 1st pick or 2 card combo. This game is more often decided during the draft phase than it should be, but even so it is one of the most fun games you can ever play while losing. Winning feels great. but even getting beat can be hilarious at times. Almost reminds me of Cosmic Encounter or something in that way (which is a crazy but somewhat apt comparison overall)."

2167,juuzzom,6,"When looking at EL’s progression I can see something of CitOW and Rising Sun here. Blood Rage is a good game, but it doesn’t quite rise to the spheres of Chaos in the Old World. On the other hand it also doesn’t dive into the torpor of Rising Sun. The excellent action point system comes directly from CitOW and as the players are at the start of the clan tracks in the beginning it starts rather interestingly. Even with only three rounds the game however starts to drag a bit towards the end if there is even a hint of AP proneness in the air. I do like the whole Loki concept balancing the game and offering another approach to gaining glory. On the con side the balance is cracking towards the end of the game with huge point swings especially thanks to clan tracks. The game also suffers from the Langian syndrome of the cool things being the least useful if your aim is to do well."
2168,Juxtatype,7.5,"The many comments about the minis are spot-on: probably the best board game miniatures ever made. They are stunning.

2169,JVallerand,8,"This is a masterpiece: a Euro game dressed in a thick enough layer of AT theme to please both crowds. I love the drafting, the combat system, the multiple strategies, the tracks and the upgrade cards. I'd love to have a bigger pool, so that not every card would come up every game. One nitpick is that the game seems much bigger, much deeper and more complex than it really is: this is one step up from 7 Wonders, not much more than that. And without the minis, this could be a 25$ game, and play just as well."

You may think you're drafting goodies but in reality you've already lost, or maybe someone screws you over with a take-that effect while someone else is running away with the win.

I feel like BR has a bit of an issue with a tendency of players being completely locked out of a game by a single bad decision, which RS fixed and added more strategic layers with less ""dafuq"" RNG moments. If you're looking for variance through deception and mind games, get RS. If you prefer quick action and variance through a little card-driven RNG, get this. Chances are that if you own both, you'll have a preference and one will see significantly less play. I feel like both are on the same level of strategic depth though and both are excellent gateway games into the heavy stuff."

2200,Kartoffelkeks,7,"Tactical optimization over three ages. Some combos are much better than others, so knowing them and beeing able to draft respective cards is key. Even falling back in the first or second age is not too importan, since the last age pumps out fame (victory points) like a beheaded vikings spilling blood. However, that also means that leading with fame in the first two ages is often kind of meaningless. All in all, never dull though."
2201,Karujin,9.7,What I like about this game is it fixes the snowball effect of conflict games by introducing the Loki deck so the losing players gain things so they don't fall behind. The winner also loses his combat card so others are more likely to win the following clashes. The drafting is quick but super meaningful since you are focused on your strategy and trying to block other peoples combos. As people get stronger you feel like the game will drag on but there are less spaces because of Ragnarok so it evens out. Highly recommend this game!

It's mostly area control game with fights, which I would like to be a little more exciting. There is not many ways to change number of figures in regions otherwise. 
I like that there are few ways to gain points and you can focus on your individual strategy, but other players still can mess with your plans.
I think I would like to own it but rather from a trade than a shop.

2017-11-04 - 7.5->7 - Is it a big drop? Not really. I just played again and like other games I rated with 7.5 a little better. This one is good too and sometimes it's really nice to jump onto one another. It's fine with 3 but better with 4. I guess the game is a little better as players have some picture what the cards can do and what you can expect.

2017-12-06 - 7->6 - I feel I always rated this game higher than I felt about it, probably because of all the hype and high expectations.

2228,Kenfeldman,6,"Quick playing combat filled game that plays from 2 to 4 players (5 with expansion).  It involves card drafting and card effects that can really swing the game, so experienced players will beat newbs.

I've played two card drafting games now, this and 7 Wonders.  I haven't done well in either.  I have a hard time remembering all of the cards when I see them and can't really envision how the cards will impact play while I'm drafting, so I feel surprised when I get demolished by some combo that another player used.  I think the rating will probably go up as I learn the cards and understand the strategies more.

While the game does have mitigating measures for losing battles (if you have certain cards), you can fall behind pretty quickly and not be able to recover if you suffer heavy losses.  Other players have to beat up on the leader to keep the game close.  I'm not really a huge fan of that either."

2239,kevincv,9,"This game is a blast. I love the card drafting mechanic and based on how cards are dealt, your strategy can vary wildly game-to-game. Combos can be huge and runaway scores with a few players isn't uncommon, but it is still fun to battle with everyone. The miniatures and boards are stellar as well. I also love the theme and artwork. Battling may not be for everyone, but seeing these figures clash on the map is always really exciting - especially when people keep adding more units to the battle and going all in. It is definitely one of my favorites. I just wish I could get it to the table more. Four players seems ideal, but I would not play with less than three."

Massive re-playability between adopting vastly different strategies and drafting different cards. 
Plays pretty fast for the type of game it is.
The only reason this isn't a 10 is because, though there isn't any ""I win"" cards, there are a few combos that are relatively easy to obtain. 
I also don't love the 60 glory point bonus for maxing stats. Seems a bit much to me.

I also like how some of the upgrades bend the rules a bit, like the one card that lets you invade from Valhalla! 

Glad this one is in my collection."
2334,krisclark0,7,"Fun game with various strategies formed from drafting cards. I like how there's no dice to determine combat results and that you have a good idea what cards other people have from the drafting. Biggest issue is trying to remember what other player's abilities are whilst also managing your own goals.

I suspect the 'death' strategy is probably the easiest as it's harder to stop someone from losing a fight. Tip: don't draft too many expensive cards as you'll exhaust your rage to quick.

Whilst I enjoy it, there's something that stops me from loving it. Can't say it's the luck element in what cards you draft as there are a lot of awesome cards and you will always have good ones to pick. The direct conflict maybe?"

It also seems to have a strong runaway leader problem until players gain more or less the same experience level; after that, multiplayer leader-bashing might help stopping runaway leaders. The game is quite a good fun area majority stuff but it's rather cruel as only clear winners of that area gain anything while the rest are punished hard(removed from the board).
This, combined with the simultaneous card play during area majority 'fights' make it less of the pure euro many claim it to be even though its mechanism elements all can be found in different Euros (mostly about drafting and area majority, a bit even worker placementish). Still, it's quite enjoyable and I guess it's even better when beginner's mistakes aren't made anymore."

Me encanta el draft y cómo los clanes empiezan en blanco pero poco a poco divergen con sus habilidades. Muy tenso, ágil e interactivo, con alto nivel de puteo. Odio la estrategia (muy válida) de ir a bloquear zonas y evitar el conflicto. Tampoco me gusta que las puntuaciones finales suelen estar poco apretadas. Escala mal. Cuantos más jugadores, mejor.

Simple to understand, fun, good looking. Strategy and tactics equally distributed. I love the draft and how the clans start blank, but little by little they diverge with their abilities. Very tense, agile and interactive, with high level of bitchiness. I hate the (very valid though) strategy of blocking zones and avoid conflict.

2389,larryjrice,8,"FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first game with three players. The board becomes squeezed quite quickly and there is no avoiding conflict. The different cards frequently feel overly powerful and it is helpful to know what type of cards are in the deck and have potential to be played. The minis are nicely constructed and detailed as expected. Also think the opportunity to ""recruit"" two monsters to help quite interesting as some of them look quite intimidating on the board and fits well with the theme. Letting someone win the middle the first two rounds of the game might not be a good idea...

Definitely has some similarities to Chaos of the Old World but this one is a simpler design and one constructs your Viking tribe as the game continues by playing upgrades which will differentiate the different players and their powers a la 7 Wonders style draft at the start of each round. "
2390,LarsButNotLeast,6,"june 2016: Last month I decided to treat myself to a big box, epic, Ameritrash style game and I decided on Blood Rage.  I've played Blood Rage three times now and I can state with certaintity: I am absolutely crap at this game. I don't just lose when I play, I get obliterated. The game really doesn't seem to suit me, hence my lower than average score. I've racked my brain as to why the game and I don't click and have come to the following conclusions.

1. Blood Rage is predominantly a card game. Yes, it has a board and yes it has crazy overproduced miniatures, but the game is all in the cards. So much so that if anyone decided to make a cardgame version of Blood Rage, it would need little tweaking. Card games aren't my strongest suit. I am a better strategic player than I am a tactical one. The card drafting at the beginning of each round is highly random. Only extensive knowlegde of the cards and memory of what your opponents choose can slightly mitigate this luck. My knowlegde of the cards isn't good enough, but every time I loose I've lost to players who've played the game for the first time. So card knowlegde can't have been the only factor.

2. Blood Rage is a tableau builder. The player who quickly builds his or her tableau has the edge over other players. And that edge can be very hard to catch up to. In my opinion the game suffers from a runaway leader. Twice have I lost the game because a player with better stats became unbeatable by the other players. End game scores where the winner has twice the points of the other players have been the norm around here.

Some people are under the false impression that Blood Rage is a mixture of a eurogame and an ameritrash game. I really don't agree with that. Blood Rage is an Ameritrash game through and through. The six cards you get each round aren't enough to think of a strategic gameplan. In most eurogames, your strategy is yours to choose. In Blood Rage, more often than not, you're at the mercy of the cards you've been dealt. It is too random and chaotic for a eurogame. And after Eldritch Horror, Imperial Assault and  X-Wing, Blood Rage has started to put me off these American style games. I probably won't get rid of Blood Rage yet. I'd like to see how my thoughts on the game will change after I've played it some more. But Blood Rage has go to be the biggest gaming  disappointment  of 2016 for me."

2402,leberschnitzel,8,Tactical Skill check with great theme.
2403,lebigot,8,"+ I like the fast turns (single action).
+ I like how each player customizes their clan throughout the game.  
- The theme is superficial, with card names that don't have much relationship with the effect.  
+ The rules are simple enough. 
$ The game feels smaller than Clockwork Wars, because of the relative lack of flavor, because of the more restricted mechanisms. 
+ Quick battles.
- I can't help thinking that this game (even the base game) has almost too many minis: I prefer games with fewer minis but more game/flavor/richness (e.g. Clockwork Wars). I feel that they add a bit too much fluff to the game.
$ The game feel is essentially that of a series of short combats for quantitative improvements (the 3 tracks), with a constant interaction between players (who compete for the territories), and a progressive customization of each player.
+ The terrain is small enough that many battles happen, with an interesting center that can be joined from everywhere (important for reinforcements), but territories that remain a bit far from each other that positioning is meaningful for battles (too far and you can't reinforce).

Overall: a lean-enough game of many small battles, with limited flavor. Almost a dry euro-like game of battles with some chrome (minis, some background but not much flavor). Well done, though, but not ""wide"" or flavorful enough for me to be in awe (contrary to Clockwork Wars)."

2405,Lecaro,6,"Blood Rage ist im Grunde genommen ein Mehrheitenspiel mit einem Karten-Draftmechanismus.
Das Spiel wird über drei Zeitalter gespielt. In jedem Zeitalter erhalten alle Spieler jeweils 8 Karten, wählen eine davon aus und geben den Rest ihrem linken Mitspieler. Das geht reihum so weiter, bis jeder Spieler 8 Karten gewählt hat, wovon jeder nun nochmal 2 Karten abwerfen muss.
Nun geht es der Reihenfolge nach, dass jeder Spieler aus den gewählten Karten eine als Aktion spielen kann. So bringen die Spieler neue Einheiten aufs Brett oder erhalten Verstärkungen/Monster/neue Anführer/neue Fähigkeiten). Diese Karten müssen mit Wut, der Währung des Spiels, bezahlt werden.
Auf dem Brett können ebenfalls Aktionen ausgeführt werden, wie z.B. die Einheiten von einem Ort zu einem Anderen zu bewegen oder ein Dorf plündern, was einen Kampf gegen die anderen Spieler hervor ruft. Gefallene Krieger werden nach Walhalla geschickt wo sie bis zum Zeitalter Ende bleiben.
Am Ende eines Zeitalters verschwindet eine Region aus dem Spiel und alle Einheiten auf ihr gleich mit. Für diese ruhmreichen Gefallenen erhalten die betroffenen Spieler Ruhm (Siegpunkte).
Siegpunkte kann man außerdem für gewonnene Schlachten gewinnen und als Sonderpunkte für diverse Dinge, wie z.B. fürs Sterben der eigenen Leute, wenn man denn die passende Karte vorher ausgespielt hat.
Ich finde das Spiel gar nicht mal so schlecht, allerdings gefällt es mir auch nicht so gut, dass ich es nochmals spielen wollen würde. Es hat sehr viele Gemeinsamkeiten mit 7 Wonders, wobei 7W sehr viel einfacherer zu spielen ist.
Mir liegt das Spiel auch nicht sonderlich. Es passieren mir immer wieder kleinere Fehler, die aber große Auswirkungen haben. Rein von der Optik her ist es auch nicht mein Fall. Das Cover zieht mich nicht an und die Miniaturen sind zwar beeindruckend, aber Minis sind nicht das, was mich zum Spielen verleitet."

2411,leffe dubbel,5,"randiose theme presentation, beautiful modeled figures, just looks great. I immediately feel like painting them. Beautiful thematic playing field and especially the large bow arch, on which the possible phases can still be explained, are perfectly opened. Kudos to the game designer. Playability: Blood Rage plays absolutely fluently, there are no rules questions. Especially the concept phase at the beginning works very well. The game has some ""killers"", you can enjoy it, but you do not have to. Above all, new players have no chance against veterans, because you must first know the cards and their combinations. Nevertheless, the game works fine. Interaction: the game lives from its interaction. There is never enough room for everyone, there are always conflicts, similar to Small World. Blood Rage lives on his ""Area Contoll"" mechanism. The Skillen of his group earlier recall a Eurogame. But you have to constantly weigh up what his teammates are doing. Influence on the game: except in the phase of drafting this game has no luck. Even if Draften has minimized the happiness party so far. that you can only draw one card at a time and then the batch is passed on. (Similar to 7 Wonders) Game charm: I love this game and I like the Theatmatic. This is super implemented on Blood Rage. The game is fluid, has little luck, always finds new combinations and is constantly interacting with his teammates. Blood Rage is really great for four or more players, but also works fine with the two of you. the game is unfortunately not well balanced to play a fair game."

I'm not a huge DOAM guy and I own Nexus Ops, which I like a lot and completely satisfies my wants in this area.

2446,littlechandler,8,"Initial Impressions: Basically met my expectations but not my hopes, as in it seemed as good as I would imagine from reading the rules, but not as good as the current 8.38 rating + good reviews + finally a good thematic Viking game + factoring in the high cost. As I thought before playing the card drafting doesn't really fit thematically with the game at all. Also I wish there was a little bit more differentiation from each of the smaller unique monsters, some are just stronger versions of others. 

Besides the drafting and the area control the order you perform your actions appear to be pretty important. Also you must choose very carefully which battles you intend to win, as using your high value battle card early can easily screw you over later on if you're not careful. Therefore, this game is more strategic than I thought it would be; the game definitely does not play itself after the drafting phase.

You don't use all the cards each game even for a given player count so there is a little bit variability there.  Also the locations of which bonuses go in which locations and which locations are destroyed create variability too, but we'll see if it's enough as I play this game more. There are multiple ways to score in winning battles, completing quests, purposefully losing some battles with the right set of cards, and getting your units all destroyed by Ragnarok, so at the very least I should be kept busy for a bit in choosing which of those I want to focus more on.

Runaway leader appears to be an issue as if you win battles/complete quests your stats will go up which will allow you to do more stuff later on. 

EDIT: Somehow I've gotten family members who normally can't play anything heavier than Lords or Waterdeep to able have a basic understanding of how this game works. If this proves true for other groups this would be a great boon to this game as being a game I can use has a ""next-steps"" game without me having to compromise in my game choice. I sometimes wish the combat cards worked similar to Kemet where unit destruction is not directly tied with winning battles, although this would make the strategy to get your units destroyed significantly weaker. 

EDIT 2: There are a lot more cool card combos than I initially anticipated, the core mechanisms of the game have continued to be fairly easy to understand (though there are quite a few less prominent rules that are easy to miss), and I think this game worked very well with 4 players."

The game is always exciting. No matter how well you seem to be doing and what cards you have, you still have to be careful or your plans could get blown apart. So risk management is a very central aspect of the game.

It's not perfect though. A few of the seemingly viable strategies are not strong enough in the end, because the cards that they rely on are too expensive for their cost. Then again no game is perfect, and this is still one of the best games in my books, so 10/10."

The game is incredibly deep.  On the surface, it may seem that aggressiveness will pay in a game called Blood Rage, but actually, it often comes down to timing.  The temporal element of this game is a big factor, and knowing when and where to act is important.  You can spend a lot of cards opposing someone and getting nothing for it.  

The game can be swingy as well.  Odin's throne can really help someone in last place and turn the whole game around for you.

2504,ltprestie,9,"By and far my favorite board game.  Plays great with both my friends as well as my family.  The card drafting phase is a great way for players to select which upgrade/combat/quest cards they want per round as opposed to just a random draw.  

Customizing your clan of vikings is a very neat and rewarding aspect of this game and is governed largely by the card drafting phase.  Players often have to make critical decisions between taking combat cards or upgrade cards.  The addition of the large monsters with added combat bonuses is also a great feature.  

Depending on which cards you choose, you can customize your clan to actually benefit more greatly from purposely loosing battles by using the Loki cards. There are also combat cards that can be played that completely negate the effect of the other players combat cards, steal rage for losing a battle, or make players throw away their combat cards and be forced to select another.  With all of these options available, you never know how the outcome of a battle will play out until it is over.  Many times I've seen small clans beat much larger ones due to proper play of combat and upgrade cards.  Many times in this game, the player who wins the most battles is not the player with the most glory (victory) points at the end of the game.

Overall, this is the best amerithrash style game that I've ever played and I can't recommend it enough."

2558,Maervok,8,"Blood Rage is a fast-paced slaughter game that will certainly satisfy the most bloodthirsty players. Although none of the provided Viking clans possesses unique abilities, the replayability is quite high as each season players gain 8 randomly chosen cards from which they pick one for themselves and then pass their pack of cards to the player on their left, at the same time they receive another pack of cards from the player on their right and this will repeat up until the moment each player has 6 cards. The cards you pick heavily affect your strategy throughout the game although you will easily end up changing your strategy entirely for each season. Honestly, Blood Rage is a bit too combative for my taste and your units die like flies very often and then return to your reserve from Valhalla so I do not care for my units while playing BR as much as I do when playing Rising Sun or GoT for example. But that's just my point of view, beside that I can't think of anything else I could criticize about Blood Rage."

-simple, streamlined play
-plays fairly quickly
-card drafting! (something I always find enjoyable)
-clan upgrades (all clans start out the same, but will differ from game to game based on the strategies you pursue & cards you draft)
-limited # of action points per round so you have to be aware of what you want/need to do and plan ahead
-various paths to victory

Cleveland was not a fan so I don't see this staying on my shelf since it's such a large box (and a bit pricey) and is best with 4.  Would likely play Nexus Ops instead (and Cleveland does enjoy that game).  They're not the same mechanically, but close enough game play experience for me.

Would like to play it more often with 3 or 4.
Liked to paint the miniatures a lot.

negative:
With the drafting it depends where you sit (before or after an experienced player who knows which cards to pick/deny for the OP combos)
to be good you have to know all the cards of all ages and keep track of who played which card and try to predict who has picked which card.

I like how it plays. I don't like the draft that much, which is the core of the game.
Some too swingy card combos which should be debited by the draft

2596,Marauder234,9,"Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. This has hit my table probably more than a dozen times, and has converted myself and my friends into gamers who are willing to play longer, deeper games. (I avoided longer games before purchasing this since I didn't think I could get my friends to play such things more than twice)
I will note that for my game group, plays take about 1:10 per player, which is definitely longer than what it says on BGG and the box. However, I'll admit that my group is perhaps fairly AP prone and not totally focused. That said, the length really does not take away from the game. I am rarely bored, as the decisions that other players make matter a great deal to me and my strategies, so I am definitely involved when someone else is moving. Perhaps I am even trying to manipulate them out of attacking me (or perhaps into it). 
In terms of mechanics, I think the game is very solid. I think every game I have played but lost, I can imagine how a different set of decisions would have swung the game in my favor, which implies that the luck factor in the card drafting is not so significant. There are paths to victory implied in the game design, but ultimately you have to play with what comes up in your draft, so I often find that mixing and matching strategies is a better approach. That also makes it more replayable, as you won't be playing the same strategy every time. After all, you might love to go all in on battles and annihilate everyone else, but if you aren't seeing any of the heavy battle cards, you aren't going to win in Ygdrasil, so you'll have to adopt some other strategy.
It can be a bit punishing: one large lost battle can really cripple you, since the battles are all or nothing. On the other hand, you can always know if you can guarantee a win or not, so you can usually choose not to commit your forces to their doom. (I recommend going over all the battle cards each age before the draft. It's simply not fair if you know what exists and others don't. Other cards, like the troll, should also be pointed out). 
PROS:
-- drafting is fun and keeps each game fresh. It's funny how unsure everyone is of their choices as we go round
-- limits on troop numbers in (most) territories adds a lot of strategic element to a game that would otherwise be dominated by cards. You can win battles with inferior forces and cards by smart placements and some misdirection, as well as pick off some enemy troops from a superior army.
-- short, one action turns keeps everyone involved
-- Elegant design. Though a game with a lot going on, it is surprisingly easy to teach, as there are more ""exceptions"" (in card form) than there are rules. Compare to Scythe, which I hate teaching, because there are just too many little details to go over. 
-- Heavy player interaction, but with limited ability to truly team up on anyone, makes this fun and social, but keeps things pretty civil. 
-- different paths to victory, but there still certainly seems to be a focus on winning battles and controlling territory, as befits the theme
-- cards that let you gain from losses can keep the game tight even when you aren't able to dominate
-- every turn is a meaningful decision
-- 3 age structure really works to give the game a sense of momentum
-- theme mostly works nicely. figurines are nice, though I don't really care for minis. Cards are nice. Board could be prettier, but at least its good quality.
CONS:
-- The name. It's over the top. Whenever telling people the name of it, I give it extra ironic dramatic flair because I just have to embrace how ridiculous the name is.
-- female clan: why do they have to be basically naked? I think it would have made more sense to make them well armored. Also, half the soldiers of each clan could have been female, since there were two molds anyway, but fine, I guess viking clans can reproduce asexually, I don't know. 
-- some cards seem rather useless. Sure, they won't get drafted, so it doesn't break the balance, but it would be nice if every card was at least valuable for some strategy. (that card that steals two glory when you lose, I'm looking at you. That will almost always be a net gain for the other player, usually by a spectacular amount). 
--  Could be I haven't figured it out just yet, but it does feel like the player who drafts the strongest battle cards and certain upgrades (masters in arms, anyone?) wins the majority of time. But I suspect that better play could mitigate that advantage, and the three drafts does make it rare for one payer to get all the best battle stuff (though it can happen)."

2614,marktenken,N/A,"Very thematic, surprisingly easy to learn (medium learning curve). Choices matter, timing is key, there isn't enough time. Battles have some chance, cards acquired thru rotary drafting. Many different strategies, very competitive. For the Glory!"
2615,marktoon,8,"Everything I like about a solid card drafting, area control board game. 4-5 plays better than 2-3. Some strategic decisions to be made on cards, clan or warrior upgrades, also which provinces to invade. Lots of choices each turn. Plays really quickly with the added thrill of the tension when it gets closer to the latter stages of the game. I really like the quality of the components and especially the miniatures!
One of those games that, if you're playing it for the first time, you do feel a little unsure about what to do or what tactics to use. But then as soon as the game finishes, you immediately want another go as the light bulb goes on above your head."
2616,Markus2000,10,"Easy, Epic, Strategic and deep."
2617,Markwerf,9,Much better than Chaos in the old world with a nice integration of draft and a bit of combat. The draft cards feel somewhat generic though and the map doesn't really come to play much it seems with adjacency only mattering for pillaging. 
2618,MarkyX,6,"An average Dudes-On-The-Map game with lots of playability due to the numerous abilities and monsters to use in the game.  It's surprisingly very easy to teach since all the information is both on the cards and playmat.  In terms of pacing, it plays pretty quickly since you are able to do only ONE action per turn instead of multiple (more board games need to do this).  The game ends shortly after the climax and doesn't overstay its welcome.

However, I don't feel the ""need"" to own this game.

The first glaring problem with the game is the simple fact that you need to know the decks inside out to play at any competent level.  Otherwise, the game just feels like you are along for the ride with no real direction to follow.  I've seen experienced players take advantage of their neighboring newbies because of newbies didn't realize that passing certain cards to him would just make him powerful.

Another problem is the numerous effects that make it hard to decipher the game state.  Throughout the session, you will encounter card effects that seem to give you points for doing almost random thing such as dying, or other people dying, or losing a fight, etc.  Unlike the younger brother Rising Sun, there doesn't seem to be any focus within the game.  You have vikings, stuff happens, and you score points.  In Rising Sun, while there are effects that give you points, the game still forces everyone to be on the same page about gathering monsters, building strongholds, and taking over areas.  

With all the faults, the game does have sparks in its design.  It plays quickly, the downtime is minimal, and it's very easy to comprehend the core basics of the game.  Unlike many other games, I feel the expansions like the Mystics and Gods actually hurt the game instead of improving it."
2619,Mark_of_Heresy,8,Quick game. Lots of killing and being killed. Point salad. I enjoyed the epic chaotic violence as much as Chaos Marauders and I liked that.

We play mostly 2 player and although it's not as fun as 3+, we still find it very fun and balanced as a 2p game.  The minis are SO fun to paint and admire.  Deliciously frustrating for the loser, and glorious for the winner... and both want a rematch ASAP.  Well worth the $75 CND I paid for it.  

Finally, I altered the clan sheets (very good quality card stock).  Using some tin snips and some metal ducting material ($7 at a home reno chain), I cut squares slightly smaller than the clan sheets, and taped them securely to the back.  Now we use magnetic (custom made from simple magnets from a dollar store) markers to track current rage, starting rage, glory/battle, and units on the clan sheets.  No more ""accidentally"" moving the stock cardboard pieces by bumping the table :D

Strongly recommended overall!"
2628,Martystrub969,8,"Very polarizing game for me. In the end, the lack of balance, abusive combos, and forced policing keeps it from being great.

-Very strategic and tactical with experienced players
-Drafting mechanic
-Viking Theme and artwork
-Miniatures quality
-Asymmetry through upgrades

Cons:
-Can be lengthy with 4 players
-Play Investment (Need many plays with experienced players for maximum enjoyment)

2631,Mashpotassium,6,"Rating based on 4 players.

Chaotic but pretty fun. I like the general mechanics of this, but it's *incredibly* swingy, and most of these swings are due to hidden goals (Quest cards). The changing powers of the players was too much to keep track of for me as well. As a result of both of these, it felt like that even though we were interacting and fighting on the board, I had little impact on what others could do because our goals could be entirely different--for a game about warfare, it felt strangely solitaire-ish, and I don't know how I could have done much better. 

There are lots of potential ways to score (it can potentially get a bit point salad-y), but the gameplay is simple, straightforward, and it does feel nice pulling off a good combo and getting a slew of points.  

The minis are very nice, but the difference between the leader and the regular warriors was not big enough.

Certainly not a bad game, and I can see how some of my complaints would lessen with repeated plays, but while I enjoyed my play well enough it's not my cup of tea."

2634,MasterCrackfox,8,"An incredibly in depth, complex, but wildly fun experience. After a handful of plays I have continued to enjoy the game throughout, however the game starts to lose a little bit of its excitement as you fully learn all the mechanics and therefore have less to learn about how to be successful within the game (mitigating the challenge of the game to a certain degree). There are minimal if any mechanics I genuinely don't enjoy, so overall the game gets a thumbs up in terms of playing. The miniatures and board are a huge boost and make for an engaging experience."

With newbie players, there's a chance a player might get a unbeatable combo (= Loki) running, when others do not counter draft the combo pieces. I don't mind that.

About 2/3 of the game is in the draft and the rest is in the execution of your chosen plan. Every victory I have seen so far has been achieved by abusing a 2 or 3 card combo (there are plenty of combos available).

I wish they would release a expansion that would completely replace all the three decks. The current expansions are overpriced."

Ultimately, this is a glorified card drafting game with combat thrown in. I was hesitant to pick this one up, because I thought it would be more of a miniatures game than a solid board game. Man, am I glad I finally caved. This game is AWESOME! The drafting is fun and grueling, the combat is straightforward yet exciting and the game has that epic feel. The components are a huge selling point, and they are awesome too. But, make no mistake, this is no miniatures game masquerading as a euro-hybrid. This is a euro-hybrid made even better with awesome components.

However, i don't really care for area majority games, and blood rage sends the Analysis Paralysis into overdrive, way worse than Five Tribes does. Blood Rage is a good game, but every decision is mentally exhausting, and this game can overstay its welcome, sometimes cutting it close to three hours. "
2650,mattersmasher,6.5,"Not a bad game by any stretch, but felt a lot emptier, less thematic, and mechanically dry than I expected. The lavish production doesn't add anything and the gameplay feels like it would suit wooden pieces better than plastic.

I enjoyed the drafting and powerful card combos, and while I appreciate the smooth game flow, play length and simple-enough mechanics, it felt like the design had been streamlined to the point that the 'soul' of the game has been polished right out of it. At no point did I feel like I was raging, pillaging, fighting, or dying for glory, just manipulating the game state to get points.

Comparisons to Chaos in the Old World are accurate on a mechanical level (power points, turn structure etc) but this doesn't have the thematic richness, nor does it involve me as much in the gameplay."

There's a fundamental issue with this game, however, I noticed it during a playthrough and haven't revisited the game since. I found that it's way too easy for one player to become overpowered, early on. I can't pinpoint HOW, exactly, but it might have to do with certain players being able to leave all their pawns on the board in between rounds, while the other players have to use action points to move theirs back on at the start of each round.

I don't know... after one round I got into an argument with my brother about it, and we ended up TALKING about the game/rules longer than we ended up PLAYING the goddamn game! I'd like to revisit it, but there's other stuff that I already KNOW I'll enjoy playing... and at the end of the day that's what makes for a good game.

Edit: I recently played this again with some friends, and I'd be willing to bump the rating up to a... let's say 6.8. There still are some fundamental problems with becoming overpowered way too quickly, but with some homebrew rules, you could really make this game work."

If it were inherently balanced then this would be another story but it relies too much on players having equal knowledge of the game and card combos in order to draft the cards as intended. In fact the game relies on this to balance the card randomness - which is something I don't like with a game with as many mechanisms (fine in 7 wonders).   Also feels like the last player in round one is disadvantaged in which starting spot they choose.

A combination of kemet tech upgrades and chaos in the old world style mana track.  A lot of fun.  Great minis and fantastic art.  Expensive price tag to match. Had an issue with brown vs maroon red and blue vs purple and orange vs green on character bases - hard to distinguish for red/green colour blindness.




"
2680,mdaffonso,10,"Amazing in every aspect. Interesting use of card drafting. Has area control, direct conflict and hand management elements. Allows you to plan somewhat ahead, though requires you to adapt to the state of the board and to the draft. Luck plays a part on it, but is not central to the gameplay. Gorgeous minis. Over-the-top combos. Allows very different playstyles and strategies to win. Everything seems overpowered, which means nothing really is.

The game has many different mechanics that work well together such as card drafting, unit selection, and area control.

CMON quality minis and components. 

Bad: 
The game doesn't have heavy rules but if you don't understand what you are drafting and formulate strategies off of your draft you will get trampled upon. There were a few newer players that decided the game wasn't fun because of this. 

(related to drafts) As new players to the game it is extremely difficulty trying to overcome the Loki (points for dying) strategy. For the games we have played it feels like the most effective way to win."

2687,Meekrob81,9,"Absolutely love this game.  Will not go into too much detail about gameplay, but essentially the game consists of two phases.  In the first you draft cards from the given round's deck, taking a card and then passing the rest to the next player, who in turn is doing the same.  In the next phase you take turns playing your cards, placing your army, and doing battle over the different regions of the board in order to gain rewards and further develop your clan.  Rinse, repeat.  As things progress you get more powerful cards, the game board becomes smaller as regions are destroyed, and more battles inevitably occur.  There are multiple paths to victory, so the most powerful army is not always the winner.  

Pros: 1) Easy to learn, but lots of strategy.  2) Quick gameplay, yet still deep and rewarding.  3) Contents are high quality.  Great sculpts.  4) It's very FUN!  (Isn't that what's most important?)."

The game is fun overall. I love the clan progression, the drafts, and the theme. Components are generally great (although CMON boxes are terrible across their line; what's up with that?).

What I don't love is the swingy nature of the game, and what feels like some balancing issues favoring certain strategies. It's a little hypocritical of me because there are other swingy games I do like, but for some reason it affects me here more than in other situations. Perhaps because in those games I take gameplay with a grain of salt, and here I'm expecting a more ""serious"" experience? I'm not sure. 

I'm also not a general fan of the CMON Kickstarter FOMO strategy, and it bugs me that exclusives from their campaigns are impossible to get for a reasonable price. It leads to them doing lame campaigns like their digital one they just ran where the figures are functionally the same, but not. Seems ridiculous to me.

"
2739,michal_kempka,8,"Played 3 times so far but it seems a solid game. Multiple possible strategies, randomness is nicely constrained, you can win by getting beaten which is quite fun. Rules seem to be unclear at times though. Miniatures of monsters are great, infantry not so great but not bad. Quality of the board and player boards is not great but so much plastic for this price is great anyway.

The rule book is very poorly written and unclear."

There are many straegies that work and feel balanced. The way the board looks on the table with the miniatures is epic. 
The only real downside is once a player pulls out ahead in board control it’s difficult to single handedly dethrone. There is always a strategy of purposefully dying though. "

Blood Rage is excellent fun. Turns move fast, drafting keeps all the cards balanced, and a light tactical area-of-control element. The presentation is wonderful as well (all painted minis).

I haven't tired of this title just yet, but I could see maybe after 20 plays, when all the discovery has been mined, that it might not be as fun.

- A lot of replayability because of the many elements that shape each game.
- It's not too hard to learn but it's complex enough that you never truly feel like you completely know the game.
- It works perfectly with any number of players (although more players will give you access to new cards and monsters).
- Luck influence is almost non-existent, only being noticeable in the draft at the beginning of each era.
- The game isn't too long, specially considering how big it is. Also, you never get bored while playing it because it's very dynamic and you have to pay a lot of attention to what the other players do."

First, I think there are a couple dominant strategies that cannot be simply out-played if the player happens to get the right cards. Additionally, I really wish there would have been some more included cards in the box that would have made repeat games a little more fresh. You definitely see the same cards in each successive game, which on the one hand enhances the strategic aspect, but the card combinations definitely feel finite.

Overall, it's amazing. The components/theme/artwork really tie everything together. The rules are intuitive and the turns are fast yet strategic. Definitely recommend."

2808,Mnemoidian,7,"The mechanics of Blood Rage are quite interesting and I usually quite enjoy the game when I play it. But after 5 plays (all 4 player games), I find that I tend to leave the table unsatisfied and frustrated. 

I think the main issue I have is that there are too few cards - I've seen them all, and they fall a bit too neatly in a few synergistic groups. I think that adding more cards to the total pool (but keeping the number of cards players keep) would really make the game more interesting to me, as you would not know exactly which cards are in play - and there would be a greater chance of ""new"" strategies appearing, rather than different people picking from the 3-4 existing paths every game.

Then again, I've found myself often thinking ""Huh, maybe it's time to give blood rage another go...?""."

There is some bending on some of the minis weapons, two of the small cards are bent but perfectly functional. Again, it is packed in tightly and ships as a single box without the add-on boxes--(not the way a chroming gamer would ever do it, but it all fits). 

The game has been played four times. 

I'm looking exclusively for Imperial Assault add-ons/expansions, Arcadia Quest KS Edition, Star Wars Rebellion, or the Queen's Gambit.

"
2814,Mochana,8,"Really enjoyable game set in Norse Mythology. It looks like a simple wargame-lite but there's a lot of different strategies and tactics you can employ. Best of all, this game rewards you for killing and dying!!! How can that be bad?"
2815,mOCHU035,8,"10 Plays

There are aspects of this game that I do not like. The card draw randomness (despite the drafting) is one. The meanness (at times) in the interaction is another. King-making is yet another. The left-right binding is a problem as well. However, I still keep coming back to this game time and time again. It has enough going for it (interesting card mechanics, personal powers, power+card drafting, variable scoring conditions), area control mechanics, the interesting combos one can unearth over the course of a game despite having played the game quite a few times, all packages in an aesthetically pleasing package and tight mechanics mean that I would almost never turn down a game of Blood Rage.

(6/21/19) = So, approximately 10 plays and I am starting to feel a bit saturated with the game. Perhaps the expansions can freshen things up. Playing with the same group a few more times also should make this pretty interesting. Still an 8/10 for me. But might move down if those subsequent plays do not meet expectations. I am also never going to want to own this game I suppose (I hate all those minis and cannot see myself every really wanting to get into them. would have liked the game more actually if they had just used abstract representations for warriors and monsters and if the tear-down was faster)."

2831,Moramora,7,"A game with miniatures!! Why would't I like it?? Indeed, playing with actual depictions of blood thirsty viking warriors and clan leaders, druids and monsters takes you (at least me) away from pure mathematical deduction of power points, hand management and area control system. Which I like in games. Theme!! Maybe that's one of the basic reasons I play them.
First impression is, that some cards (especially some particular improvements) are overpowered and first (out of three) era is underpowered considering game effect. ...And that card drafting at the beginning of each of them is absolutely crucial for establishing a hand of proper balance / ratio of generally three kinds of cards. So no chance for luck for newbies against those who played Blood Rage at least once before. ...But I'm sure it's just the first impression."

2847,MrBadguy,7,"I bought this game thinking it would be all about territorial conquest and fighting but really, it's more about card drafting since card combos score the most points.

2848,MrDer,8,"Blood Rage is a bit of an odd one for me. I can't say I'm ever really excited to play it, but it usually ends up being a good time. It's a great beer n' crackers board game, that gets better as you get more intoxicated. Watching friends make fatal errors of judgment is fun in its own right.

This game suffers from a bit of an identity crisis however. Though its weigh is medium or even medium-light in terms of mechanisms, the depth of strategy in the game is anything but. It took me many, many plays to feel like I knew what I was doing, and actually assemble some sort of strategic combo. The good news is that there's a lot of variety to strategies that work, once you figure out how to make them work. 

Also, the game is hilariously unforgiving. This would be a negative for most games, but here it just adds to the experience."

The minis were pretty great looking, but I was unimpressed by most of the other components for the price.  The game and player boards just felt cheap, and I was not that into the artwork.  

Besides that, it wasn't horrible, just not my kind of game.  I had heard that there were a lot of euro-y mechanisms but between the draft and the battle it felt little more than glorified rock-paper-scissors.  This might improve with play and knowledge of the other cards in the game, the varying strategies.  But I just didn't find it that interesting.  I have a love-hate relationship with area control games.  I often don't mind games with some majority bonuses, a very typical euro-type scoring, but games that rely heavily on area control, descendants of El Grande, have never been my favorites.

I would play it again, and I think I could enjoy it a little more, having better expectations going in.  But overall, I just didn't feel the game stood out like I hoped it would, after so many rave reviews. "

The game is simple enough, it might be a bit overwhelming at start when you get 8 cards in your hand to choose one but you quickly understand how things work and the flow of the game is pretty fast and quick, I don't think there's much chance of AP (except during the draft) because you pretty much know what you want to accomplish and what you have to do to get it and only if someone screws badly with your plans before your turn you won't know what you want to do.

2898,muzfish4,9.9,"I backed this one a while ago and it arrived in good order not too soon after it was due (delivered in October with a September projected delivery time); for a KickStarter that’s practically an early delivery. Mrs Fish liked the look of the large packing box (yes, I went all-in for the 5th as well) and decided it would make a dandy Xmas gift for her husbandman. Which it did.

Anyway, over the Xmas break I unboxed the goodies (much to the delight of the Little Fish), read the rules and got pretty excited about the game. From what I could see it was everything that I hoped, add on excellent production values including some superb miniature sculpting and I was keen as keen could be to get it onto the table of honour.

Fortunately, it was pretty easy to find other interested parties and I managed to get in a couple of games at a local games meet-up the first with the base set and the second with both the Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard and Blood Rage: Gods of Ásgard expansions (discussed below). I also took it along to Cancon and taught it to three new players which was good.

The base game itself is a pretty good game, very engaging and one that has a lot of challenging decisions. Starting the round with card drafting is interesting as it gives a player a chance to ‘read’ the play for the next Age and work out what one’s opponents are up to as well as working out what they need to do. Building a decent ‘engine’ is also rewarded as having complimentary abilities on all your cards is very important. These are skills that will come with experience and should add a lot to the replayability of the game.

The game encourages bold play and there are plenty of ways to score point so that a bad round does not necessarily put a player out of contention. So, in short, a winner a keeper and one game I’d like to play again and again."

2927,NardDogMystic,9.7,"This game just does so many things right. The ""dudes on a map""/area control/combat is awesome. The drafting is awesome and makes the engine building very very satisfying. How your engine builds makes the combat even more exciting. And the ""multiple ways to get points"" aspect means that even when you are getting slaughtered in combat, you could still be racking up points thanks to your hidden objectives. And you can start to see how these elements all connect and flow and make for a very satisfying and fast paced experience.

The theme is awesome, the minis are some of the coolest I have ever seen, and this is all just beautiful window dressing on what is one of the 10 best games I have ever played. If you like hand management or drafting, or engine building, or area control, or combat, then you're in luck because this game has a little bit of it all, and no other competitive game I have played combines all of those elements quite as well as this. Hats off to Mr. Lang with this one."
2928,nargles6,8,"Love the theme. I don't like how lucky you have to be to get a monster in the draft (they get drafted immediately, so if it's not in your first stack then you're out of luck). I also don't see how a Thor or Odin-based strategy would work; Tyr and Loki seem to be the best battle cards. FYI there's this one card that my group has found to be OP (it lets you invade with an additional warrior for free). We've removed it (and have to playtest more), but so far we're enjoying the game more."

Now for the bad, the Loki strategy is too pervasive and way too powerful for a turtling strategy.  Every time it's used completely takes away all my enjoyment of the game."

Once stripped from the overproduction and the theming/clothing of a wargame-ish area control game, Blood Rage turns out to be more akin to a victory point salad than I'd like. About everything scores, from upgrading stats on your player board to losing battles (!). There are lots of numbers to get track of, many cards you draft are a bit unexciting, many others railroad you into seeking pre-written personal synergies rather player interaction. If that's your bag, fair enough; just don't expect me to sing its virtues.

Not to help, while I'm usually willing to put a lot of suspension of disbelief into board games, a large proportion of the big scary-looking monsters offer one of the finest examples of ludo-narrative dissonance in the medium; being more often than not a mere ""That's it?"" passive ability that mismatches the overproduction of their miniature with your unfulfilled desire to wreck the battlefield with it."

In the best possible way everything is swingy and broken and wombo combo in this game and it feels enormously satisfying to feel the impact and synergies of your actions. 

Behind all overproduced bombast, martial slaughter and stupidly-gory (but not bloody enough) background setting there is a clever tactical and overall mostly balanced area control/drafting game, which I full heartedly love and recommend. Encourages me to start painting my stuff."
3014,noom777,6,Not much replayability.
3015,Norairo,6,"This is really your standard CMoN joint: incredible minis (by Studio McVey) and so-so gameplay, overhyped due to the former and the kickstarter perception distortion field.

The kicker this time is that CMoN scavenged an earlier design so it's not so much of a bust in terms of gameplay, but the game is far from perfect and it's filled with overpowered card combos that swing the game all over the place.

Fully Painted"
3016,norifurikake,8,"Really fun game, has odd runaway possibilities.

3017,Normandy,8,"Not normally a game I would purchase or play. But all in all, the miniatures are well detailed and the gameplay similar to a beer and pretzels atmosphere of gaming.

Table presence, especially in the final round when the big monsters come out.  There's clearly a solid game in there, but ... well, it's a game of might, destruction, and glorious death.

3021,notwebsafe,7.5,"I was worried this wouldn't appeal to my family since it's kind of a ""dudes on a map"" game, but they enjoyed our first play of it; as such games go it's actually not that complicated to learn. Plus the minis are cool :) Will have to see if we can get it back to the table."
3022,Novatheorem,5,"Probably the most accessible of Lang's Dudes-On-A-Board-Controlling-Stuff games if you ask me, but just not very interesting beyond the theme. A lot of other games scratch this itch more for me. Worth owning, and will definitely play if someone else wants to, but not a go-to for me."
3023,NowOrNever88,7,"Blood Rage thoughts after one game (second place 141 points to 90 points to 80 points and 171 points). Hmm. Felt like one person ran away a smidge. But still fun I think trying to catch up and use a Loki strategy. Not sure the replay after seeing all the cards a few times but like the different monsters, miniatures, leaders, upgrades, and Battle cards for variety, and I think it felt more refreshing than remet. May be good to have for the variety despite runaway leader? Valhalla and quest points isn't enough probably....? Or maybe it is if you become good enough. Storage seems reasonable if you don't mind damaging figures a bit - not big deal prob. Catch-up is nice since you keep cards when you lose and usually get points for dying or being in Valhalla various ways. Won't always get Loki cards so some tension whether you win or not but if you don't get them opponents are more likely to wanna lose. Interesting balance of strategues and likely some cool hybrid strategies. Kind if like a more refined and slightly faster Chaos in Old World with symmetric starts but quick asymmetry arising like in kemet. Theme eh but not horrible - just dislike the dying but miniatures do look really cool. Overall liked it a lot and felt like good interaction and pretty climactic enough battles. Downtime low because one action but one person can get a lot of rage and leap ahead in action...not sure how I feel but overall didn't mind THAT much...assuming they play quicker which they will.balance seems good with draft and lots of memorizing or strategizing against others cards."

Despite that a perfect theme with amazing miniatures and a very good drafting system combined with area-control. Also no diplomatic parts, pure stategic placement and bashing."
3076,Oneliness,10,"This game's aesthetic hides a very complex and amazing area control game.  The aesthetic is beautiful (although the font can be confusing at times).  I love the drafting mechanic, and I don't have a problem with hidden information and cards because, like many games of it's kind, prediction and probability are a part of deciding whether or not you want to build your forces up or engage in warfare.  It is also a style of game that rewards time and plays to learn its nuances and deck powers.  The game is controlled by three ages, so it does not drag on and ends at the perfect time.  I can see where complaints arise about the visible display of points on the score track, but often the game is decided on the final battles where one player will acquire and play that one card in battle and, if they win, get an end of game bonus that manages to inch them into the winner's spot!  Cannot recommend this game enough.   "
3077,onewingedangel777,9.1,"Solid, well-balanced game with simple rules but nonetheless complex interactions. Very different experience whether going for a 2-player or 4-player game. The theme is great, and you really feel like a pillaging mob going berserk until the end of times. The difference in scoring can be significant and not knowing the cards is a big disadvantage though; therefore, you may want to give good advice to new players and educate them on the implications of their actions... otherwise, they may easily get brutalized, leaving them with a bitter aftertaste."
3078,onhech,9,Great gameplay. Amazing minis. If everyone knows how to play you could play this in 40 minutes. Would love to try the expansions to add a bit more variety in gameplay.
3079,oninoyakamo,7,"From its components I worried that Blood Rage was just going to be another Kemet, (which I despise). Not so!

BR's smart integration of its Norse theme creates a balance in strategy from each card reflecting the personality of God bestowing the Gift. Some give brute force, some are crafty, some favor the underdog. BR's philosophy of honor through death constantly clears sections of the board and relieves the calcified territorial battling that occurs in other area majority games.

The worst thing I can say about BR is I detest its Kickstarter funding. Having discovered the game late there is pretty much no way I'll ever get my hands on the KS Stretch rewards which makes it feel like I'll never get to experience the full game.

BR is very combative. Scores usually have a wide spread, with crushing losses that can be dispiriting for players.

Oh, and I think the name is dumb. Blood Rage doesn't conjure to mind a viking game. It's predecessor, Midgard, was a better title."

Because without the gewgaws of the admittedly beautiful miniatures, it's an average weight dudes-on-a-map game.  And this leads me to a bigger issue...

This game is being lauded by reviewers who received their $100+ game as a freebie.  I'm glad that these people appreciate this game and are taken in by its design, both as a game and as an object.  But these people are influencers, and these people are conveniently forgetting that for us mortals, us people who don't get free games on demand, we have to pay $100+ for a game that could have been distributed for ($20-60) without the bullshit.

Monsters seem very powerful on the board - perhaps overly so? But dominating on the board is not a sure path to victory. I'd like to play more."

3100,Orphebus,7,"All the production stuff has excellent quality: illustrations, minis, graphic design, cardboard...

It's the best blend between eurogames and tactical ameritrash I've seen lately. It's clearly superior to Chaos In The Old World, as many people claim. The draft mechanism is key, but so is the order of your actions, and adapting to what other players deploy and do on the board... It manages to create tension and maintain it.

On top of that, the gameplay is quite fluid and and it has an good game lenght of around 90 minutes.

Not everything is perfect in Blood Rage, though:
-> Runaway leaders (and players with no hope of catching up) will happen often
-> Some cards seem overpowered :-/
-> Some cards interactions are not covered in the rulebook
-> Not enough cards of each era to reinforce replayability.

Overall, it's a very interesting mix of american and euro games. Able to produce both great and dull games.

Gioco di maggioranze territoriali dove la mano di carte conservate fa la differenza, spesso anche le sconfitte portano a piacevoli risultati in termini di punti vittoria.

This game definitely has a fitting title, as watching your entire army get sent to Kingdom Come when you were sure you had the victory will definitely have you seeing red. Good play length as well for my group (usually around 90 minutes). Deep enough to scratch the strategy itch, but quick enough that a loss doesn't crush your soul."
3115,Overexposed,8,"Enjoyed this much more the second time I played it. It's satisfying to pull off strong combos of cards. Drafting is always a card mechanic I enjoy, and having three totally different types of cards in your hand makes it interesting. Probably the most constricted, limiting, war game I've played; the map even shrinks as the stakes and power grow.

As a matter of fact, the primary mechanics at work here are rather dry card-drafting, area-control, and action-point allocation.

Whether you like these kinds of Eurogames or not, it is hard to appreciate a game that more often than not has wildly differing scores at the disappointingly anticlimactic end; the winning player commonly ends the game with around 100 points more than the person in second place, with players in the middle of the pack rarely ending with scores even within 25 points of each other. Needless to say, almost every player I have shared this game with came away disheartened and frustrated.

3139,Panzerknacker,7,"Euro-AT-hybrid with a clear overweight of the Euro side. With 3 players, too deterministic for me. Way too Euro-ish for me. I want more randomness. For example, I'd love to roll dice for combat and would still prefer CitoW over BR any time for that single reason. Dislike that stupid drafting mechanism, hate it when it all comes down to victory points. Nothing is more boring than a calculated victory by having the most victory points! 

You see, Blood Rage does not only visually appeal to your fellow viking metal maniac. Blood Rage is the game incarnation of that type of person with a hair cut and a beard like a viking, drinking met out of a bull horn while wearing a grim Northern Folk-Viking-Whatever-Metal shirt. But that guy enjoys tax declaraion as a hobby and washes his Mercedes on Sunday.

Still, BR is a very much okay game. Also a very good looking one."

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]I had reservations about Blood Rage and they ended up being right. We played a few more times and I just didn't find the game fun. It really is as simple as that, Blood Rage is my least favorite dudes on a map game I've played to date. I normally love drafting in games, but not in Blood Rage. I didn't find the different god cards you draft to be that interesting; most of the synergies were very clear cut and didn't require much thought to execute. Combat resolution was okay, but I much prefer the card based system Kemet employed versus this one. Blood Rage failed to connect all the different mechanisms into a cohesive game play experience. 

I know I am in the minority, but I really don't get the hype surrounding Blood Rage. Is it really the minis? Either way, Blood Rage is a game I'll be avoiding in the future.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Battle resolution is great, you know the strength of each unit but being able to play a card adds uncertainty to the outcome of the battles and adds to the strategy of deciding when to pillage. 
- Relatively quick to set up for this type of game (my biggest gripe with Kemet).
- Not sure how fun the game is with three, I think it may need four to be more competitive, but I'm only two plays in so this may change.
- Mini's are nice, but the warriors all suffer from droopy weapons. Personally I find the mini's from Kemet to be far superior, even the smaller warriors.
- The other components are lackluster, thin player boards, tiny cards and bland board artwork.

I'm not sure where I stand with this game yet, I definitely need and want to play it more. I've played two 3p games with my kids and both have been absolute blow outs. I know part of this is just learning the cards and combos in the game, but I also feel like three players may not be the best player count. I can't even imagine playing with two. I also keep thinking that we are playing things wrong, but I think we got most things nailed down for the second game. It would be nice if the supposed FAQ they are working on would get released. 

As it stands my kids are having fun so it'll continue to get played, but I'm not sure if it'll remain in our collection in the long term. Of course I could also see us really enjoying the game a lot more once we understand the nuances of the game play. Right now if I had to choose I still prefer Kemet, but this game is much easier to set up and teach. I guess time will tell.[/i]"

3144,paramoreta,8,Cool game. I find it a bit oversized (literally) in all senses but it is well balanced and pays off if you like viking themed games.
3145,Paratrooper1942,9,"I always enjoy playing this one.  The Kickstarter monsters allow even more tactics to hone or counter strategies and add to the replayability.  While I wish that the Kickstarter exclusives were made more readily available, I still love the choices in the basic game.  Drafting the right cards for your strategy is important, as well as paying attention to what your opponent's strategy seems to be.  This one has never disappointed me.  Recommended for 3-4 players.

3149,Pascal157,5,"After three games, I believe this game is too much luck-dependent, random and unbalanced to please me.

The cards global distribution and the cards received are the two randomness factors. You can somehow mitigate this by knowing all the cards in the game and by memorizing the cards received and passed... But a ""memorize all the cards game"" is not my kind of game. 

Some cards are definitively more powerful than others: Those who knows the game well will know which cards are worth keeping and which are not: They can build a much more effective strategy than the other players.

It is no surprise to me that the player owning the game has won the three sessions played... The fact that the winner had more than four times de VP of the loser clearly reveals the balance problem.

賣互動的遊戲
重點在輪抽能不能組合你要的組合技
行動階段則稍微想一下決定執行順序即可
要被圍毆好像也不容易
人多可能比較熱鬧
但是每個城鎮的大小限制又讓人多策略性會降低
算是還不錯的遊戲
模型真的是大加分
規則:
*主圖板跟其餘圖板放置，放一個綠色邊緣的掠奪標記在中央世界樹獎勵面朝上，其餘隨機開著放在其他八個省份，8個滅世標記隨機三個文字面放在時間版圖對應位置上，把末世標記放在該回合的滅世標記指定省分。2/3/4人時隨機拿3/2/1個滅世標記放在其對應省分上，該省分遊戲不使用，根據人數移除對應卡牌再根據牌背洗勻放在時間版圖對應位置上，世界標記紀錄回合
*每人拿一個種族版跟所有模型還有底座，所以模型跟船都裝上該顏色底座或帆，計分標記放0，種族標記放在個人圖板的三個計量軌第一格，跟怒氣值6的位置，隨機起始拿起始標記，每時代結束會左傳
*遊戲進行三輪，每輪有六個階段，利用時間板塊紀錄
1..輪抽階段 之前輪的手牌先放著，然後發這時代的手牌每人8張(第一場遊戲第一輪可不輪抽)，輪抽每次留一張，值到保留6張，剩下的棄掉(2人時一次選兩張)
2.行動階段 怒氣值移到起始格(能力可能讓你增加)，由起始開始輪流動作，需要支付怒氣的就支付，怒氣到0的玩家自動pass，選擇pass的玩家怒氣也自動歸0，在所有人pass或是所有未被毀滅的省分被成功掠奪後，行動階段結束
>侵略  支付等於單位力量的怒氣值放單位到任意外部省分(中間不行)的空村莊上，船要放港灣，放領袖不花怒氣，場上單位數上限等於你圖版的號角數
>移動 花一怒氣移動一個省分(港灣不行)所以村莊的單位到另一個省分的其他空村莊上(包括中間，中間沒單位限制)
>升級 支付升級卡力量值(左上)並放到對應圖板欄位，可蓋掉之前的
*如果是單位(領袖，戰士，船，怪獸)升級，可馬上免費做一次侵略動作
>任務 蓋著出一張任務卡在圖板對應位置，沒上限
>掠奪 選擇一個有你單位(船在港灣也可)位被掠奪的省份進行掠奪
a.從你左手玩家開始，輪流可選擇移動一個相鄰此省分的單位到此省分的空村莊上(不花怒氣，pass玩家也可以做，船不行)，直到滿或每人要進來，如果沒有其他單位跟船在此你直接掠奪成功，直接獲得獎勵將掠奪板塊翻面，但沒有分數
b.出卡牌 每個有單位在此的人暗出一張卡(除非沒牌)，一起打開，只有戰鬥卡增加戰鬥力跟效果，每個人把其單位戰鬥力總和(包括卡牌，沒單位也會算卡牌)
c.結算 戰鬥力最高獲勝，平手都算輸，輸的卡牌都收回手贏的棄掉，輸的人移動所有單位到valhalla圖板，發動掠奪的如果獲勝可拿掠奪獎勵並翻面，如果輸就沒事，然後戰鬥勝利的獲得其個人圖板斧頭值得分數
*一個港灣相鄰兩個省份
3.棄牌階段 棄到剩一張，最後一的時期全棄
4.任務階段 打開任務卡，如果完成條件就拿獎勵，比力量的平手算失敗，會加總相鄰港灣的船
5.諸神黃昏階段 拿此回合對應的滅世標記放到對應省分，毀滅面朝上，所有該省分單位跟相鄰港灣船都移動到VALHALLA圖板，並根據時間圖版的獎勵拿分(2/3/4分在1/2/3時代)，然後移動末世標記到下個要毀滅的省份
6.所以在valhalla版圖的模型回手，所有掠奪標記翻回獎勵面，起始玩家左傳，回合標記下左移
*遊戲在三個時代後結束，加總個人圖板的三個能力額外加分(4/5格+10，最後一格+20)，分數最高獲勝"
3161,PaulDavidson,4,"This game flopped pretty hard when my group tried it. By the mid-way point, the winners and losers were already a foregone conclusion, with no real catch-up mechanism available.

But oh my god, this is a really good game! Blood Rage has many elements I love in classic Euros: a great Norse mythology theme, card drafting, multiple ""tracks"" for resources and victory points as the game's deciding factor for a winner. The game's turns are fast and easy to understand; most of your time in the game will be spent deciding whether you should join battles when another player ""pillages"" an adjacent territory. Blood Rage is a terrific entryway game for people who want a bit more theme and interactivity than a typical Euro. But the game is also great for veteran players because it has a great foundation of solid mechanics and flawless gameplay. Definitely a recommend for everyone! Now on to painting those miniatures!"

Doing away with all the placement cards turns the game even further from area majority (the bane of fun), and into a game where you're just slamming guys on to enjoin battle in various areas. Battles are won and lost on the cards you play (gained 7 Wonders style at the start of the round). The really nice thing is you can do well in the game by losing all your battles, as there are oodles of ways to gain points when you lose. It's a matter of building a strategy with your card draw, and flowing with it. I'd happily play it again, but I'm not sure continual conflict games have enough in them to keep pulling me back.

3179,pekin2121,N/A,"This game has area control, collapsing territories, card play and upgrades....many good elements. The area control works well and is limited by the zones in a area (once all the zones are filled up, no more units can enter). Territories are destroyed by the Ragnarok in each of the 3 ages; this really tightens up the board and forces players/forces to interact. There are many upgrades, so I can see each game being different. You can upgrade leaders, ships, units, clans, monsters, etc. What you can do on a turn is limited by the amount of Rage you have (which you can upgrade as well). 

One of the most visually stunning parts of the game are the HUGE monster minis. There are 4 included and any player can get them (by spending Rage). 

Overall this is a really fun game. Combat is different, as you only fight if one clan pillages a territory but that's not a bad thing.  "

3229,Phrim,7,"Blood Rage is a game in which players create armies and try to take part in glorious battles before the impending Ragnarok ends the world.  In each of the game's three rounds, players first draft a number of cards that provide special abilities, give them access to new units, grant victory points for certain end-of-round conditions, or help them fight battles.  Players then use their limited resources to deploy their units and fight over the various territories, earning points for the battle and bumps on tracks providing income, increases in the unit cap, and increases in battle rewards.  At the end of each round, a pre-determined region is destroyed by Ragnarok, and units left in that region are killed but earn bonus victory points.  While this seems fairly straightforward, a number of upgrade cards provide ""perverse"" incentives for losing battles, having your own units killed, etc.  I'm a little concerned that such cards may be overpowered in comparison to normal strategies.  Also, I found it was too easy to ""camp"" regions, as if a region is full of a single player's units, it's almost impossible to dislodge him.  Despite these misgivings, I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable game, with a wide variety of interesting strategies and gameplay.

There is a lot to like in this, but I often found that this game feels pretty one dimensional.

We've also had weird runaway leaders in this one, too. It seems like 1 person is always really far ahead a few people in the middle of that and one person in DEAD last...like not even close.

The sides are symmetrical and draft cards from a common pool, so that completely kills the asynchronous beuty of CitOW. The battles are deterministic. The loser can get rewards. There are too many actions that take 0 Rage. Objectives are secret and therefore not only far too easy to obtain but also generate no additional drama or impact on the way the game is played. 

It's got a respectable skeleton. The Yggdrasil area is very good design what with the central nature and the vastly superior rewards. The action pool is still a good design, spoiled slightly by far too many 0 cost actions. The monsters are kind of neat. 

If CitOW didn't exist I might have somewhat of a higher opinion of this game, but as it stands I've seen what can be done with the area-control Euro-trash hybrid and this just doesn't hold a candle."

I can't say enough about how fun this game is.  I don't own the expansions but I wonder if I even need to with how great it is out of the box."

While one on one fights are good, the way everyone who is in the contested spot gets to (has to) join in the battle - that's where it can be really surprising. All the different upgrades, the drafting every round, the tricky Loki cards, the myriad ways to score points and build a strategy - that's why I love this game. "

Blood Rage uses a number of mechanics from card drafting, to area control to card driven combat.  You are vikings fighting for glory before the land erupts in fire and all ends in Valhalla.  But their are many strategies you can employ to gain glory.  Will you be strong in battle?, will you go after quests, or will you submit to your enemy and get glory by dying.  How you play is determined by you and the cards you draft.  Everyone I have played with has LOVED this game.  The artwork is good .. not stellar, but the miniatures are some of the best you will find in any game period!  You have a clan of warriors and a leader but can draft monsters and ships to aid in your quest for glory.  Wow..just wow"

There are a few cards so good that there's no point not picking them up which makes them a little imbalanced in my opinion, but I still enjoy the game. The theme, the plunder, the battles—it's all a little over the top which means it's 100% Viking approved."
3284,PopeBrain,8,"(4 plays) A quick an brutal death romp.  The factions become unique through a random card drafting mechanism that make for a huge variety of faction combinations.  The card play in battle can be heartbreaking, with lots of cancel cards and spoilers.  It's a fast and easy game to play, so that's OK."
3285,Popesta,6,"Haven't played it yet, but it's on the way to my house.  Based off of the mechanics alone this is an automatic 8 in my book, the question is whether or not this will jump to a 9 or 10 after a few playthroughs.

Finally got to play the game and I think I'm going to leave it at an 8 for now and possibly move it up to a 9 in the future.  After about 3 games I've seen 1 issue with this game, and that is lack of unique strategies.  I have not played the game with the two expansion packs but I've heard that they do not add a ton to the game.  What it needs is about 3-4 more cards per god per age, also the powers need to feel actually different and unique rather than stronger versions of previous ages.  But the game is great and my nitpicking is nothing that an expansion couldn't fix.

Blood Rage has definitely gotten stale for me, I moved this one down to a 6.  I honestly have not opened up the expansions for this one yet, but I don't see them adding that much variety to this game.  It's a cool looking game, and is a great gateway game for area control noobies.  But there is not enough depth in this game to get me to play it a ton, there's not enough variety of strategy and you are at the mercy of the draft."
3286,Poptech,10,"A game that gets better the more you play it. Due to the  card drafting for each age no two games are ever the same. Find a way to demo this game if you are unsure you want to buy it. Highly recommended to play with 4 players. Again, this game only gets better with the Gods of Asgard and the Mystics of Midgard expansions.

Pros:
* Beautifully detailed miniatures.
* Simple to learn but hard to master.
* Well balanced and play tested.

Cons:
* The board's graphic designed is muted and could have been better.
* Various cards are removed with less than 4 players."

3292,Pozman,7,"Had some very high expectations of this one, seen the extremely high average rating of 8.2 (03/06/2016), but my one play so far was a sort of a bummer. 
First of all: this is a way overproduced (as the warriors could have been easily replaced with simple cubes like in most majority games) sort of majority game. But my biggest concern is: there seems to a certain number of winning combo-cards and if someone has those, there is simply nothing you can do, apart from waiting until the game is over (which I must admit isn't that long). The only way to solve this problem is to know all those combo's and prevent the creation of such a combo, but that requires a lot of plays of this game off course :s

To end, a sidenote: in the beginning I thought that you could win with a sort of losing-strategy (by the Loki-cards who give you an advantage if you lose) and that would be a cool thing. Then after a full game, I don't think it can compete at all with simply being the strongest one and pillage a province. Simply because pillage improves yours stats, which is a big advantage, as it lets you score even more points by winning a batlle and gives tons of end points at the end of the game as you reached the end of a track.

Edit 12/06/2016: Increased rating after second play as Wim proved you CAN win with a losing strategy. It seems harder, but it's great that you can win by losing :D"

There is way too much fluctuation in a player's standing during the game. In one turn you think you are winning, in the next you are almost out of the game. If a few of the overly powerful cards are removed from play, it may improve the game, but I haven't tried that yet.

Players then draft cards which will define their strategies and goals for that round. At the end of the round, a region explodes and gets closed off, making each subsequent round tighter. This game is really fascinating as you explore the ways the different cards and strategies interact. It's also great that combat is only through unit strength plus a single card played, meaning it's diceless. This game satisfies the desire for minis combat and has uprising depth.

The miniatures are stunning, the battles are tense, and the rules are fairly simple.  Set up is long, long, long, but the game is satisfying enough to justify the effort.  It is undeniably conflict-based, and that can lead to runaway leaders or players that are left in the dust early in the game, but proper strategy can make losing battles almost as VP-lucrative as aggressively dominating the board.  Plays well with five players (but requires an expansion, which irritates me).  
Probably my favorite CMON game.

3362,Qumpelblase,8,"Die besten Miniaturen auf dem Markt, grandioser Card-Drafting-Mechanismus, verhältnismäßig leichte Regeln- und obwohl es in diesem Spiel ausschließlich ums Kämpfen geht, ist ein gesundes Maß an Taktik mitinbegriffen. Grandioses Spiel. Vorallem die Loki-Taktik (Punkte für gefallene Krieger) ist innovativ und macht das Spiel so einzigartig. Kritikpunkt für mich: das abrupte Ende der Runde, wenn alle Orte geplündert sind erzeugt zwar komplizierte Entscheidungen, lässt starke Kombos oft aber einfach unberührt, weil sie zu lange dauern würden. Außerdem bin ich ein Riesenfan von Variable player powers, die das Spiel bestimmt nicht schlechter gemacht hätten."

3364,Qwitcher,8,"I enjoy this game a lot... (especially after 30+ hours painting all the minatures).  Blood Rage is to me kind of the next step up from INIS.  It focuses a little more on combat, but the best part about it, I've mostly played it at 4 or 5 players, is that almost any plan that involves the board will be messed up before it comes around to your turn again.  The chaos makes me happy, unfortunately if you have compulsive planners this means their turns take forever."
3365,r0t1prata,7,"As good as Kemet I guess? But tile ""shopping"" is replaced by cards drafting at the start of every age to form your main strategy.

Unlike Kemet where battles can be initiated just by invading, BR battles are only initiated if someone pillages a province and neighbouring opponents wish to stop the pillage, provided there's empty spots for them to enter the province or they are already in that province.

Definitely not the game for me, I'd choose Kemet over it in a heartbeat. Might be more fun once you actually know all the available card options, but I doubt I'll ever get to that point."
3395,rashaadali,6,"Only managed one play so far. A bit aggressive and lucky (a lot seems to be determined by the cards you get) which is mitigated to an extent by the drafting (not really). Don't understand why races are not asymmetric, would have thought that was obvious. One of those games where if you've played before, you definitely have an advantage over your opponents. Not because you have a strategy though, but because you know which cards are worth drafting as opposed to others. Probably better confrontational games out there.

It's a bit derivative and there's nothing really new here, but overall, it's a very good, streamlined package, that plays really fast and provides some interesting decisions.

Euro-ish war-game with a bit of 'take that' mechanism, which definitely caused some strife with my children, especially by 11 and 13 year old, although even my 17 year old was mad at me a couple of times. Not a lot of players looking at their cell phones between turns, because turns went quickly, but I still caught a few phone glances. Games are fairly quick, along the lines of Cosmic Encounter.

3411,Razorboy,9,Wow wow wow! Blood Rage was my personal Game of the Year in 2015 and even more than two years later I still play it as much as I can and still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time! The expansions are not a must-have but they add a lot to the replayability and depth of the game.
3412,rcmoore4,8,"Wow! What an amazing experience playing this game! Even though I was seriously trounced, I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's one of the most engaging games I've played in a while.  Even when not my turn, I was constantly thinking about my upcoming turn and trying to deduce what the others were trying to accomplish. 

This game combines many different mechanisms in a deeply strategic way. The drafting is crucial, and, as I found, it's just as important to consider what you're passing as to what you recruit. Giving someone, say, two identical quests can really set that person up for a landslide turn for example. Even the deterministic battle was sweat-inducing.  The battles were simple and victory is sweet when you can get it (and want it) and agonizing when you don't.  

My game group loved it as well...even the guy who HATES card-driven mechanisms in games (and who actually trounced us in our first game)!  It's a game I'm eager to get back to the table, and it likely will despite our infrequent game schedule (1/month) and the size of my collection.

The production quality is top-notch. I didn't get the kickstarter version, but honestly, there's so much in this game I don't miss the few extras that came with it.  I appreciate that the retail version has plenty of monsters and alternative sculpts for the warriors.  There's really no excuse for not enjoying the base game.

"
3413,realityfoible,6,"Not my jam. 
I appreciate the design, but it feels too Ameritrashy.  Certain ability combos are ridiculously powerful, and once a player gains momentum through card effects the game is over."
3414,realitytrip,6,"I wanted to like this more than I did.  I love Chaos in the Old World, but the balance in this game feels off to me, while all of the cards are overpowered, some are crazy ridiculously overpowered, especially if one of more players are unaware of them, due to them being chosen first before the cards are passed.  I also feel like the crazy powers of the cards overwhelms the board presence and many times the board presence outside of having a presence in a province was superfluous.  This game is still interesting and I would try it again, but not nearly close to the hype for me."

3417,reckoner,8,"Got to play this for the first time 4 player, I have to say it was a blast. The game plays fast and smooth and there really isnt enough time for someone to be a passive player. You have to get in and get your hands dirty FAST. Also a lot of games can have that feeling of not wanting to be ""the jerk"" but this game doesnt let that happen because everyone is attacking everyone is dying immediately and honestly dying isnt REALLY setting you back and in most cases it scores you points if you play your cards right. 

The main point is that by the time the game was over we were all laughing and having a great time. We sat for about 10 minutes just talking about peoples card synergies and how they were able to score the amount of points they did. 

Doesnt overstay its welcome and honestly leaves you wanting to give it another try. Not sure Id be interested in 5 player but 4 was great. "
3418,recursyve,8.5,"I have only played this solo thus far (first play through before getting it to my game group table) but oh my word does it have potential. I will absolutely, undeniably, LOVE this game. It has almost everything needed. The question is how soon can I have the game group up and running.
EDIT: This game is SO much fun with 4 people. First play through with 4 people yielded some amazing results. Everyone enjoyed the simplicity of the game. Teaching the game required a first age run through, then we reset the game and started drafting. Most of the time during the game the waiting was more on what people wanted to do during the draft. This is where the delay crept in. I would imagine that a second play through would be MUCH faster since people have an idea of what cards are out there. Overall, I would say this was a gem of a game. I did reduce the ranking a little bit (9->8.5) as it kind of felt a bit squishy. However, I may raise it again after playing a few more times."
3419,Red22jlj,8,A most excellent game.  I first tried it at Origins when it first came out but we only had a limited play.  Finally played a full game and loved it. Good to have a cut throat attitude when playing this game.  Great miniatures.  I would buy this game for the right price.
3420,Redbeardin84,3,"All the worst parts of worker placement, card drafting, showdown cardplay, spending limited resources, and territory dominace in one game.  If a game can ruin your chances to compete because the player that drafts before you takes away any card that threatens a comeback, then why play more than the first round instead of 3?"

3422,Redd85,10,"After more than 30 plays Blood Rage still stands the test of time as my number one boardgame. It plays smoothly and relatively quickly for a game of it's weight. The drafting, combat system, and production make this area control game just outstanding. While some games have come close to knocking this one off, sometimes prematurely due to their newness factor, I continue to make sure I play them multiple times to verify, and they always come up slightly short. Just a great game that will certainly go down as a classic in the Annuls of boardgaming history.

I got crushed in the first game, not knowing at all what I was doing but placed second in the other game, not too far from the first player in part because I pillaged the last region and caused the game to finish before the other two players could compete certain quests. Then placed 1st and 2nd in the other games a week later. I do love the fast playing time and multiple paths to victory, though the wargamer in me means that I'm still not able to lose by design (Loki and Fenrir strategy).

It has a style that you cannot do the same strategy over and over again because you don't start with the same cards and your way of playing the game has to adapt to what the others players are doing.
In the end of the game there can be a lot of comebacks and the player who was winning by the time it ends won't necessary be the winner of the game when you count the points, and that is cool."

For me, every second of the game felt like that moment in Yugioh where someone shouts ""you've activated my trap card!"" Sure, there is little bit of control in drafting the cards at the beginning of each round, but the actual execution of battles is almost entirely unpredictable. You drafted high battle cards? Well, I drafted cards that cancel high battle cards! Bet you didn't see that coming! I won my last game by simply sitting in two zones, filling them up with my warriors, then drafting all of the Quest cards. This is not a good game."

3457,ricomoss,2,"This is one of my biggest disappointments.  I expected so much because people have touted this game as so amazing.  I very much disliked this game.

First, it seemed to have a huge run away leader problem.  If someone is lucky enough to draft some cards that synchronize well early in the game they can jump to an early lead.  If you weren't able to get many upgrades in the first age AND had your troops destroyed during the first age I don't think you have any chance of coming back.  It's just not fun for that player.

Second, the luck of the draw isn't HUGE, but it's definitely noticeable.  There are decidedly better cards than others for each age and if you didn't happen to draft those cards you are going to have a bad time.

Third, the battling is so over rated.  There are too many battle cards in the game for the amount of battling that will occur.  It's too easy to avoid conflict because it's too easy to stack the odds in your favor.  If you see someone coming into your territory and you can't win, just leave.  This is a bit of a simplification, but I don't want to go into all the details to explain this (it'd take too long).

The miniatures are awesome and the components are pretty great, in general.

3469,ringo84,7,"Ameritrashy game with some Euro mechanics. Card drafting is the central mechanisms and way to individiualize your clan. Combat is interesting and there is a lot of out-thinking your opponent. Key is to discover combos of different cards/powers and also utilize them to score a lot of points. There is certainly skill involved.

Even though it has no dice and some mechanisms are Euroy, this is a pure Ameritrash game to me. Combat and take-that events are such a major part of the game. But this is also a reason, why I think it is a good but not a great game. 

Miniatures are gorgeous and art (especially on cards) is good. In total I understand why this is the game of the year  for a lot of people."

Can be argued that you can get a runaway leader problem, it's not too friendly for new players. I'd suggest not drafting with new players as the book says. Fantastic game."
3471,Riotactor10,8,I only own the base game so I can't comment on the expansions (other than 5 player which I've tried) but I quite enjoy this one.  The board gets tight through the 3 rounds and makes for some nice conflict.  I do feel like some of the cards are a bit too synergistic and forces players to draft to block others instead of developing their own strategies.  It also leads to games being outright blowouts in some cases.  It's too fun not to like though.  
3472,rioterism,8.5,"After reading a lot about Blood Rage, decided to buy the game. Definitely a keeper and a super interesting, strategic board game full with viking themes and great artwork. The rules are easy enough to understand but the game offers a lot of different plays, tactics and strategies and each game differs from the previous one. No matter whether you win or lose - it is fun for everyone playing which is very nice and important. The plastic miniatures are simply great - awesome production level and really help dive into the theme of the game. In my opinion - one of the best and most amusing board games I have played that provides lots of replayability and fun to all participants."

Definitely a little Nexus Ops and Cyclades are in there as well.  All of these are games I rate highly.

It combines so many things in so many quality ways.  You have your starting army, you have your starting stats you have a clever mechanism for invading and attacking.  There are no dice.

This game is really well thought out and just a true joy to play, even if Sam Healey stomps you into the ground cause everything that can go wrong in Stage three does.  But it would be a shame for anyone to miss having a chance to play this game.  If you have the opportunity, try it, just be aware, strategies exist to stomp you into oblivion so be aware of them so you can use them or prevent others from doing so.

3482,Rob Beekman,7,Games started to play out the same everytime. Got rid of it before I burned out on it.
3483,Rob Doupe,8,"Fast, furious, thematic fun. The card drafting adds a layer of strategy to what is otherwise a pretty shallow game. End scoring is huge, and that may leave a bit of a bad taste in your mouth. Fortunately it doesn't overstay its welcome, so you can play again or move on to something else. "
3484,robbdaman,4.1,"Not well balanced at all IMO.  To swingy with cards and dependent on drafting more than anything else.  May as well just play Sushi Go and avoid the extra 1.5 hours of the rest of the game.

Also calling this a great viking themed game is silly, it's got some of the aspects but at no point did I feel like I was sending vikings off to pillage and die honorably to go to Valhalla.  Bleh."
3485,robble03,6,Rating after 1 play. Like the different mechanisms and straightforward combat. But drafting well will take more plays than I'd care to invest in learning the cards. Still fun and great minis (even if they are hard to get on the table given costs)
3486,Robbo_the_dude,9,Fun and streamlined game. Figures are really nice. Might be a bit chaotic for some during the pillaging. More to follow when I get a chance to play again.....

Light, fun tactical scrum with players utilising card abilities to complete quests, introduce monsters, buff their troops or just mess with everyone.
Played well in our 3 player game.

Reviews suggested it plays ok with 2 and it does !
Yay - might be able to convince the wife to like area control games yet....

Ok - the more i play this, the more appreciative of the card draft design behind this area control game.

After several games, there are quite a few rules that could do with a FAQ.  4 players seems to be the sweet spot.

Now with werewolf."
3492,robinfifth,9,This game is so gorgeous! I enjoy the fast paced battle to control the board and the hidden quests that keep you on edge because you never know what people are after. I really enjoy how Valhalla also can keep players who weren't so fortunate in battle to keep them self in the running for jarl of jarls!
3493,robinz,8,"I've only played this once so far, although I expect I'll get to play again before too long. It was a 5-player game, and was really quite a lot of fun. It reminded me more than a bit of Chaos in the Old World (by the same designer), due to the general dynamic of paying to summon units on to the board, upgrading those units to give them special abilities, and having them fight each other, without this fighting being necessarily the whole point of the game. In other ways, of course, it is very different - lacking the asymmetry and the cool alternative routes to victory, but with other elements like the Quests and the 3 different upgrade tracks. Not to mention the crucial card draft at the start of each of the 3 ages, which I suspect between experienced players will constitute the real ""meat"" of the game. I thought this was an excellent game that I'd love to play again. And the miniatures, particularly the huge ones for the monsters, are very impressive too :)"

3510,roctheengy,10,My favorite game.  Started playing this among many others and 9 months later it is still the one I want to play.  Wish they had named it something else; I find the name alone turns casual players off.
3511,Rod Chapman,7,"The ability to gain points for warriors killed in battle is fine but  there is a tendency for players to throw warriors away in suicide missions. Whilst the Vikings saw dying sword in hand as the best way to go they usually fought because they were after economic gain, military success and glory. They did not seek futile engagements. As in Germanic warfare, warriors would fight to the death around their chief.

Apart from this minor criticism, the game is entertaining and plays quickly. The monster figures are particularly well done."
3512,rodenbeckb,9.143,"The best miniatures I've ever seen. Fun game with lots of action. It's a game about battling for control and to pillage, and that's what it delivers. There's no place for people to hide. Add in the drafting and card bonus effects to make things unpredictable and exciting."
3513,Rodge,5,"The obvious start to this is that the figures are fantastic. Really detailed and great to look at. The larger monsters have a nice weight to them too. This is, undoubtedly, what will attract a lot of people to playing.

The card drafting aspect is a decent mechanic - it just doesn't work overly well here. Some cards are obviously superb and should always be taken, no choice required. Some are terrible and are easily passed until you're stuck having to take them. The size of these cards is also an issue - why do they have to be so small?

This leads to the most important bit - gameplay. It's an original idea, alright. But it's not really all that good. Area control and fighting, normally a decent concept. The idea of getting points for defeated fighters is unique. But, for a fighting game - it doesn't seem to engross you as actually battling. Throwing men into a hopeless battle, just so you can pick up a few extra VP from their death - doesn't really tie in to the idea the game gives you, of Vikings in glorious combat ending in Valhalla.

The length of the game is also an issue. If you read my reviews, you'll know I'm a big fan of longer games. But when there's not that much happening that I care to track in a game - the longer game just turns into a chore.

So overall, the excitement factor in this game just isn't there for me. It's an OK game that is simple enough to pick up, but would be one I'd have to be talked in to playing again rather than suggesting to anyone to bring it."

3516,RogueDeckbuilder,5.5,"Only game more overrated than this game is Scythe. Seems every Miniature game falls under the same umbrella, overhyped and the only reason that they get such good ratings is people like the minis. If this game were cubes or meeples I am sure it wouldn't get such raving reviews. If having ""cool miniatures"" is the defining part of the game, then count me out. Area control was messy, blind auction combat is always bad, you play this once you have seen and experienced all the whole game has to offer. Ok, but soooooo overrated. "

3534,Rontuaru,7,"To be completely transparent, I expected this to be rubbish after my horrible experience with Rising Sun. Thankfully, it is very different, and shares more mechanisms with its far-distant ancestor set in the Warhammer world. As an aside, CitOW is still my favorite of the Lang saga. I enjoyed Blood Rage for what it is: a strong area control with quaint, if outlandish, mythological Norse themes. Now, here's the sour spot, and from what I can tell it is the hot take—the Loki strategy, though I suppose thematic, is a little bit bogus and oddly hokey, namely because it's so easy to pull off. So you're telling me that the counter play is to play around it until I can suss out who is really gunning for it by the end of Era 1 at the earliest, then just make sure this player doesn't die from me all game? And trust that the rest of the players do the same? And oh I can't refuse to fight them if they pillage in an area I occupy, anyway? That's a one-dimensional and stale conclusion to the meta which will likely cause my opinion of this game to deteriorate upon further plays."

3546,rtam,6,"Blood Rage is meh for me. There's nothing special about the drafting of the outlandishly tiny cards. All the ""hype"" comes from the miniatures, and I am not one to get very excited about miniatures. There is a problem with catching up to the leader; a bad first age means you are almost certainly going to lose the game. Playing against experienced players is a nightmare, and you'll almost definitely lose then too. While I'm criticizing, I also think spending ""rage"" as a resource is a little tacky.

Aside from this, the art is pretty good, and the combat system is interesting. I'm a fan of the board slowly shrinking turn after turn, squeezing the players together and forcing more interaction. The center space fights also add a lot of tension. These are really neat mechanics that are enough to make me want to play at least a few more times. Not a game I own or want to own, but I'll play it with the right people from time to time."

1) Quest are somewhat mandatory. But it helps balancing the various strategy and give some focus to your placement
2) The pillage of the middle, if left uncontested, can lead to a runaway leader (happened once or twice). But it is mainly the player fault since this is an area control game.

1) The combat system offer simple but interesting choices during the draft and the battles. Moreover, it gives the opportunity for bluffing
2) The tight rage management forces you to make though choices
3) The draft offer a lot of variability from game to game and allows you to chose how to customize your clan
4) The draft forces you to adapt to your opponent and often it is a though choice whether or not to hate draft

3583,ryzawy,N/A,"reddit 2015 recommendation
""Blood Rage deserves a spot on this list, for a couple of reasons:
It nails asymmetric gameplay, allowing each viking clan to create their own identity through the course of the three eras.
It plays very fast, oftentimes having an era end before you expect it, meaning you can't mess around
It encourages aggression to the highest degree, very much like Kemet, meaning there's no time to sit back and watch or build up - it's time to fight right out of the gate
The Battle cards are incredible, and allowing up to all 4 (5 with expansion) players to participate in a single battle blows most other similar games (Kemet, as good as it is) away when they only allow 1v1 at a time.
The shrinking amount of space to fight only reinforces all of the drive towards aggression."""

But unfortunately some combos are way too much unbalanced and definitely it doesn't work well in two players. I fear this one is not so great compared to other games of the same genre, simply because it's not so deep: the major problem is that if you don't hate-draft some cards, you will lose even if you won't use those cards as an important part of your strategy. It's all about balance.

:thumbsdown: A sceptic could say this is an overproduced game.
:thumbsdown: Experienced players often have the upper hand over new players due to their knowledge of the types of cards that are in the decks. The first time(s) you play, you're mostly familiarizing yourself with the different ways to win rather than really having a shot at winning against more experienced. I've seen this discourage some new players.

3624,Sarchiapon,4,"This is a game based on viking barbarians who long for a glorious death in battle so that they can enjoy the afterlife in the Valhalla. That being said, why such a game should have such simple and anticlimatic combat rules while being mostly an area control game with the chance of being swinged completely by an handful of gamechanging cards, is totally beyond me. The miniatures are nice, but they are not worth the ""fights"" they are going to be used for. With a completely different settings (and with more balanced cards), this game would work way better, but as it is, it's not about vikings having epic fights, it's about vikings having a stroll in the countryside and eventually sit down to play a completely broken card game. Pity."

I have fond memories of this being the feature of one of my favourite game nights in recent memory. 3 games in a row and I just wanted to play it again afterwards.

It doesn't work with 2 players only, so it's not going to be played regularly. My recent play didn't seem to mirror or live up to the previous experiences. "

Such a brilliant game. I think what is most impressive, is that in addition to the sheer beauty of the game, its mechanics keep all involved engaged at every moment, its pace is quick/slow in contrasting moments, and the game is done in one hour. Amazing strategy game with the perfect amount of luck which brings fun.

3655,Schwartzkopf,9.75,"THIS is my number one game of GenCon 2015. After one play under my belt, it was an instant hit.  After half a dozen plays, it is one of my favorite games.

I bought this on a whim on the first day because I knew it was going to sell out quickly.  I'd heard good reviews form several podcasters who all had wildly varying tastes so I knew there had to be something to the game that would appeal to me.   

Honestly, it is one of the best games I've ever played.  There is no fluff in this game.  Everything is essential.   One of the comments I've read said there is ""chrome just for the sake of chrome"" in this game.  I can't get on board with that statement. The minis are over the top gorgeous, of course, but everything else was so streamlined, from the uncluttered board to the functional, intuitive player mats.  It's not one of those huge FFG games with 1000 components.  There aren't dozens of different damage markers and status icons, etc...Everything has been stripped to the bare essentials in this game short of reducing the Minis to wooden cubes.  

There is so much to like here, but I'll focus on my favotirite thing:  Card drafting.  The card drafting is amazingly agonizing.  Not because you cann't find cards you want, but because every card is incredible.  You want them all.  And you know everyone else wants them all, and you definitely don't want to pass them anything juicy but you are going to!  The choice is between a fantastic card and several other fantastic cards.  Drafting is also easy for new players.  Each card is associated with a particular Norse God - just pick one or two names to focus on, draft them, and you'll have a great engine all ready to go!  But the great thing is that you don't really have to get locked into one particular strategy - you can change your strategy from round to round just by drafting a different set of cards.

This also plays surprisingly well with two, even though I miss seeing more variety in cards each round.  

Instantly one of my favorite games of all time."

3658,sciflyer,6.5,"I feel like I should like this game way more than I do. In theory, it should work for me. One of the issues may be the need for the group to self-correct. I've had a lot of runaway leader games of Blood Rage. Playing this with your head down like a Euro is a recipe for a bad time. Unless watching someone blow past everyone is your idea of a good time. And I've been on both ends of this: winning and losing. Neither of them were a fun experience. 

With enough plays, I'm sure it gets to a point where people see stopping someone from scoring is as good as scoring yourself, but I haven't seen that style of game yet. Adding in new people starts the process all over again. 

Would try this again, but there are so many other games I'd rather play that I probably wouldn't suggest it. "

3708,sgosaric,1.5,"Blood Rage relation to Citow is kinda like ... 
[i]you know that dude you knew at high school that was really into metal, wore long hair and did crazy stuff all the time? Now you meet him 15 years later and you barely recognize him in his business suit, short hair, immaculate attire. But he claims deep down he's still rock'n'roll and shows you a tiny tattoo on his ankle (under Hugo Boss sock). [/i]

Instead of figuring out how BR is a hybrid (if it is) it would easier to point out where it's not an euro.  
- There's drafting, but not 7W style, but more of MtG vibe as what you draft becomes your hand. 
- err ... that's it, the rest is quite euroey. 

Sure, there's combat. Which manages to be even more deterministic and calculable than in Smallworld. You count the value of your armies and compare numbers, add some more numbers hidden in your hand and voila. But the numbers from your hand aren't really hidden as they were firstly drafted and secondly if you lost a combat everybody knows what you have. So, no tension here. And tension is even more diluted because people don't necessarily care about winning as there are ways to get more points by losing a fight. Huh? It's a good sign a game is far far away from ameritrash when visceral enjoyment that makes playing the game fun does not giveth points. This game is like the Risk version with the least amount of risk(ing) possible. 

What bothered me the most is how designer controlled everything is and how little impact players as a collective have on the dynamics of the game. You're just doing what you're doing, countering other people's plans (not people directly!). Cards are orchestrated into three balanced eras (blah). Where's groupthink? Where's bashing on the leader? (okay, there might be some traces of this, but didn't see it in our game). 

Oh yeah, remember the area majority thing Citow had? It's kinda sorta still there, but diluted - some cards you draft allow you to score majorities. But: Firstly - getting majority is not as hard to accomplish (as you have a choice between 2-3 different areas). Secondly - quests are hidden. So, while traces of area majority remain, it creates no tension thus its soul is gone. 

Blood Rage seems like a study in how to take the structure of Citow and make it as euro-ey (balanced, calculable, tension-less) as possible. While the game isn't as optimisation prone and MPS-ey as workerplacements, you can pick old school euros like T&E or El Grande and they have more player dynamics, more tension, more psychology, more people in them! 

Maybe this game is actually a different type of dude than I described above. 
[i]It's the metal dude guy you meet, but turns out, that's just his visual attire as he's managing 10 bands, organising 3 festivals, while having another million dollar business on the side, a yacht, and a villa in the posh part of town, and of course he's married into a rich political family. The metal thing -   merely make up.[/i]

I wish I had been into the hobby with this kickstarted but... all I can do is look forward to the future (a.k.a Rising Sun's KS campaign ha!).

This game features a variety of cool mechanisms that work quite nicely together. Card drafting was the thing that initially peaked my interest.

Over the course of the game every player will develop a unique clan that has it's own unique strengths and approach to earning glory. And each approach is a legitimate winning strategy, if executed well. Speaking of earning glory, the gameplay and the theme (of viking clans vieing to earn glory before ragnorok) are perfectly integrated.

Finally, it has to be said - this game is gorgeous, especially if you paint the figures. The Kickstarter extras are great, but I haven't felt deprived for not having them. Set up this game at a meetup and you will _always_ attract potential players."
3736,Shimaaji,6,"Overall it's a really nice area control game. The drafting component unfortunately exacerbates the problems that are already bound to occur if you have players with different experience levels at the same table.

The main advantage of Blood Rage is probably the potentially lower play time. The difference isn't significant enough for me to choose this over other area control games. So I'll probably end up playing things like Rising Sun, Lords of Hellas or Cry Havoc instead of Blood Rage.

EDIT: I considered raising this a bit, but for now did not. The first time I played this half the players basically knew all the cards that were in the draft while the other half (including me) had seen maybe one or two cards during the rules explanation. Maybe that really was the problem.

Take note that, for my BGG ratings, I always stick to the BGG rating ""descriptions"", meaning: My rating reflects how much I personally want to play a certain game, where a 6 is a ""will play if in the mood"" and a 7 represents a ""usually willing to play"" and on that scale a 6.9 just is where Blood Rage belongs for me. I'm not trying to give objective review scores ... and I just felt like mentioning this now because in this special case my rating is especially low compared what I might rate this at if I were trying to hand out objective scores ... probably one of the largest discrepancies on my entire list.

EDIT: In my personal ""want to play"" rating competitive games like this one have fallen significantly and the rating just no longer did reflect my willingness to play these types of games, since there were quite a few games between 6.1 and 6.9 that I'd much rather play."
3737,shirtman,8.25,"Held off purchasing it originally because I though it looked complicated...but boy was I wrong. It implements a very clean and streamlined drafting mechanic which dictates which actions you will likely implement during that round. This mechanic supports multiple strategy styles from round to round and there are many routes to victory, something not seen much in area control/fighting games. A  fighting game that can be taught and learned very quickly, offers multiple paths to victory AND plays pretty quickly...this is the only one that I know in my collection that ticks off all those boxes.

When you're first playing the random card selection changes the game completely, after drafting your hand and knowing what cards exist, you can plan how you want to play. First play-through we did each hand random and I was shafted by the cards I had, others had perfect hands, so much that my brother lapped the score board twice after all points were calculated, more points in 1 round than existed on scoreboard. Drafting is a necessity to play correctly. Great because you can win by battles or by suiciding battles depending on how you play."

3774,Sinizar,9.5,Amazing game and very popular at our game nights.  I enjoy how the drafting really changes up the game and the anticipation on what the other players are going to do.  Playing a quest to get another player to make their move so you can then play one of the monsters that changes the points they would receive at the end of the Age keeps the players on the edge.

3785,SirHandsome,7,"[i]If You Like Drafting AND Area Control... you Will Love this Game[/i]

Better than Kemet. Doesn't fire CitOW as I heard from some people, this is more comparable to Kemet as it is focused more on unique upgrade paths rather than innate asymmetry. Instead of drafting from face up upgrades ala Kemet, you draft like a card game.

Feels like a tight design where the diff paths are very balanced yet you still get to feel powerful and do crazy shit so it doesn't feel too sterile.

You are rewarded for predicting your opponents intentions because of the action point system which is cool.

On the downside, all the different ways to get points are so balanced that they lead to lots of little optimizations at times (micromanaging VP i find not fun). I guess they call this ""Victory Point Salad""

I feel like it won't have as much replay for me as I'd want it to, and actually expect rating would trend downward on repeated play, but for now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt as first play was really fun.

3788,SirKittsalot,7,"Overall a very good game, but really most of the game takes place in the card drafting phase rather in the actual area control phase. This also unfortunately  significantly rewards experienced players who know what to go for in the draft over new players who don't know what to target or what to watch out for (e.g., Loki strategy). Since I generally play with a large Meetup group where players are not consistent from game to game, this type of advantage doesn't really work for me."

Now, if that's the kind of game they wanted to make, I think they succeded. You've got your cool start-of-round drafting, relatively short play time, wonderful components and seemingly balanced gameplay. It's a flawless package actually. But it's not unique og special in any way, and to be fair, sometimes that's perfectly fine. I just expected more. 

Blood Rage is like a Hollywood blockbuster. High production value, great special effects and a famous director behind the camera. In the end though it just lacks something I can't define. Like a lot of smash hits from Hollywood, Blood Rage is in the end, forgettable.

3849,Smwilkin,9,"4 Player Game: 9/10. The four player game fixed all of the problems below. The drafting, while it took a longer time, made the game more balanced. The person who won actually beat all of us by  creating a Valhalla engine that was giving him 5 points for each figure that he released from Valhalla (ended up with a 55 point swing). I was going for the quest route and lost by about 10 points. The game is much longer with 4 players (especially if some are new to the game), but it makes the game much more tense, exciting and balanced. 



2-player game: 4/10. It's kind of hard to rate as I only played a two-player game which was a horrible idea. The mechanics and game play were decent, and obviously the miniatures are amazing, but the two player game was horrendous. First round, my wife won a huge battle by playing  a +5  from her hand, and that was it for me. After being decimated in that battle, I could not come back. She was able to freely pillage the board while I had to spend the rest of my turns getting people back on the board.  Since the warriors carry over, she maintained her dominance the rest of the game. Also I had the misfortune of drafting 0 quest cards during the final round--making it literally impossible to win; I just forfeited instead. So, while I can see that there is a good game at the core here, this is one of the worst two player games I have ever played; a game like Inis has a much better battle system for 2."

The game is not complicated. You draft cards each round, which you can use to customize your clan (they all start the same). These give you new abilities, recruit additional forces, etc. They are associated with one of several gods, each with a particular style of effect (e.g., better combat, more VP, tricky effects). After the draft, everyone takes actions one at a time -- move on the board, attack, etc. At the end of the round, VP is awarded for control of one of the regions (specified at the start of the round, subject to change based on some card effects).

There are some interesting systems at work, but you definitely have to be aware of the card powers and such -- I, at least, would need additional plays! This might be worth another go despite the drafting, although I doubt it will become a favorite of mine."

3869,solidhavok,8,KS version with all extras
3870,Solipsiste,6,"Only a few games in right now, so the rating is subject to change. The game is pretty to look at, has great concepts and found a way to avoid the issue of the ""drôle de guerre"", where no player wants to attack because of its weakening effect on one's forces. It's a stretched logic though: I understand the glory of dying in combat, but it becomes a rather poor justification for voluntarily killing tons of units through suicidal VP generation.

My biggest gripe with Blood Rage right now is how chaotic the games have turned out to be. Card effect ranges from ""slight advantage"" to ""game changer"" or even ""VP maelstrom"". When you trigger a conflict (pillage) you just have to hope some wild effect will not turn your well-thought plans into a shockingly bad move, but there is not that much you can do to anticipate. Costs seems off too. There is a ""1-cost"" card that allows you to get a VP for every unit lost at the end of an age, while other costlier cards have very situational effects and/or lower VP potential. Green cards are a bit curious too. It's usually pretty easy to fill the requirements, having not to win a territory, but only dominate in one of the region's territory. It's hard to tell that a player is even trying to fill a quest requirement by looking at its actions, and the fight for territorial dominance has rarely been tensed and harshly contested.

Sure, you can technically see several cards in play in a given age through the draft; sure, the draft tends to create a ""somewhat"" equal distribution of strong cards, but I have started to see this mechanism as a warning label: how wild can you go with cards imbalance by simply telling yourself, as a designer, that the draft will just even things out? And the logic has its limits too. In any case, all of this brings the game closer to Ameritrash than I expected when I was reading the rules.

Got a few more plays in. Still love the game, but it's quite swingy and sometimes the draft screws you over. All part of the game, but knocks it down a little for me. Also the area control elements aren't quite as strong as I originally thought which has led to some disappointment with the experience, but still a very solid game.
--

Was extremely skeptical about this game and was turned off by the hype it had. Played this weekend and... amazing.

The theming and miniatures are spot on of course, but the gameplay is really where it shines. I really liked the drafting in Blood Rage. A lot of tension in choosing which cards to keep and which cards to pass to the other players.

I was also pleasantly surprised that Blood Rage played more like a euro, yet it still scratched that ""fight and kill with my units on a board"" itch. I liked that there were a lot of strategic decisions in how much you might commit to Yggdrasil or if you might sacrifice units for more glory or whether to focus more on battles or quests and how that affected the drafting phase.

Just altogether a great package. Simple but deep. Random enough with the drafting that it's pretty fair, even for those who have not played before. Love it. 

One of the easiest to read rulebooks ever written."

Here every player can do something completely different.

At two players, if a ""Pillage"" action is not contested, then the pillaging player automatically gains the rewards.  I also felt that it was inherently more valuable to gain the Rage rewards early, in order to be able to take more action in later rounds, whereas having higher axes was not as important given that the glory rewards for quests were guaranteed, but glory was not gained in uncontested pillage actions.

Even though didn't know the cards when the first draft started, by the final round I was able to make good choices and found myself in contention at the end of the game, winding up second. Smooth play, relatable mechanisms, and a fun time!"
3921,srand,5,"Inexplicably popular point-salad euro in Ameritash clothing. Miniatures are deployed to the regions of the game board, which can be ""pillaged"". If uncontested, the player takes the value of the bonus tile there; if contested, all present players play an attack bonus card, add up their units' strengths and the winner scores glory points from the battle. It's also possible to score glory from special cards, from dead units, from completed quests (typically have the most strength in a specific region at the end of the round), having units in a specific location destroyed at the end of the round and so on. Timing, tension, blah blah blah.

Despite the miniatures -- not Games Workshop calibre but otherwise excellent: better than previous CMoN games and substantially better than ""boardgame quality"" -- it's very much a euro in style. The key strategic element is the card drafting at the start of each round, and the issues typical of that mechanism are compounded by the limited card pool (many single cards) and strong focus on card synergy. A player's success is to some degree predicated on both random card distribution and on their opponents' willingness to hate-draft.

The rest of the play is highly tactical, with broader strategic concerns emerging chiefly in determining which units to leave on the board for the next round and where. But drafting again makes this difficult; planning for specific quests, for example, is unreliable. As expected from an Eric Lang game, chaotic special card powers abound, so there is certainly no such thing as a sure thing. 

This is another hybrid design that seems to me like the worst of both worlds. From its Ameritrash lineage it gets expensive miniatures and random effects; on the euro side it gets unthematic, abstract point-salad. The theme works only if you try very hard.

Don't get me wrong, the game does work. There are, being charitable, multiple paths to victory (uncharitable: several ingredient ratios to compose a salad), and genuine player differentiation emerges from the card draft. There is significant direct player interaction. It's just not enough.

What I find particularly bizarre are the favourable comparisons to Cthulhu Wars, a game with some similar mechanisms but genuine asymmetry, much more focused gameplay and much more theme. I would choose it in a heartbeat ahead of this one.

If Stefan feld were to design a wargame it might look like this."

This, by the title and and the description is supposed to be a war game but in reality it is a card drafting game and not a very good one for sure. The drafting game happens only in the fist 5 mins of each round and if that doesn't go to plan, you will be sitting there for an hour without any hope. And this can happen very easily as the cards are heavily imbalanced i.e. some cards are much much more powerful than the rest.

The only flaws I'd say it has is that some of the player combinations are OP and unless you play with a consistent group who know how to hate draft, experienced players can demolish someone who is new to the game.

But what really disturbs me (and detracts from the game!) are the gorish illustrations and the (totally unnecessary) miniatures. They are even worsening the gameplay because they don't even show the strength of the character they portray (like a regular game counter would do). If you are a 10 year old boy, you probably find these miniatures cool, but for me they are crap.
But I am afraid as long as people are collecting close to a million dollars with projects like this on Kickstarter we will see more resources and talent sunk into the production of ""showcases"" like this instead into the development of really sophisticating new games."

In my first game I spanked everyone else at the table.  I had a really good first age and managed to pillage the central area.  Then in the second age I got wolfman, which combined with some Tyr's cards basically let me ""halifax hammer"" my way to victory.

I had the ability to keep my cards after combat.  I had the Wolfman who meant that each fight was only with monsters (so I couldn't be beaten by sheer numbers) and my Tyr's battle cards combined with my Tyr's clan upgrade and the battle card that let me play it for 3 strength after everyone had played their battle cards meant that I had a guaranteed 11 strength in every fight and my opponents could only use monsters in battle, meaning that they had to come up with at least 7 damage to beat me (which didn't happen).

I was able to get an early lead and in this game I never lost the fight for the centre and by the end I was almost apologising I had so badly snowballed the game.

I also had Fenrir who I used on the final round to grab 20 points.  I had to work for it though and it felt great when it came off.

Honestly this game was spoiled by the Wolfman."
3960,Steve Chapman,8,"This is definitely one of the best dudes on a map style games. At the end of the day though, that's really all it is. The hype for this game, is a little extreme in my opinion. I'm not sure, that if you just took away the over the top miniatures (especially those monster minis), that people wouldn't be quite so gaga over it. I guess that is part of the overall experience though. And please understand me when I say this is a really good game, just not the holy grail of games, that some make it out to be. The component quality is thru the roof on this game. Some of the best plastic minis out there. It has hybrid mechanics, that stand out, to make this better than most other games in its category. Along the same vein as Cyclades and Kemet. These games completely replace most of the old plastic heavy Amerithrash games of the past. They are all kind of an evolution, for that side of gaming. The more I talk it up, the more I wonder, if it really is worth the hype. Haha. I still didn't like it enough to keep it for myself, or my gaming group, but I can see why others do enjoy it. I guess it's fair to say, that if you like Amerithrash, and don't mind sacrificing the old dice battles, for better card and stat based area control/ battles, then you will like this game. One of the few 8's I will give to a game I didn't keep."
3961,Steve Sunner,3,"There are no strategic objectives to combat in the normal sense.  More often than not you are actually trying to get your guys killed.  You're units parachute in to anywhere on the board and, because everything is so close, mobility isn't really that much of a factor which makes it feel like a worker placement game.  Plus, card drafting through a deck of unintriguing choices is probably the most important mechanic in the game.  I'm down on Blood Rage because I was expecting a more traditional combat-oriented game and that's definitely my bad but as it is (a worker placement, card drafting mess) I think I kind of hate it."

The game is still fun and has a lot of cool upgrades and stuff, but I'm also disappointed about how the Kickstarter edition had so many special things that changes the game that isn't in other editions. Also, combat feels a bit lackluster in some aspects where you know you'll lose and won't have a chance of some crazy wins. Would maybe be better if there were more battles and more conflict with bigger swings, but definitely not a killer for me.

+ Great theme - we still did not get our Viking helmets, but that’s on our list. And listening to Led Zeppelin while playing is mandatory. :)
We played games with 3, 4, and 5 players (-> expansion), and all of them were really enjoyable.

In practice, the miniatures look muddy and confusing on the board if you don't go out of your way to paint them (and really, if I were in this hobby to paint miniatures, I wouldn't be playing boardgames). The promised highly interactive gameplay gets completely overwhelmed by the card draft - if you do poorly in the draft, then you are going to do poorly in the ""play"" phase of the game.

If one player has a real good first round he may lead the game until the very end. If you have a weak first round you will properly also suck in the next two rounds."
3985,StrayFire,7,the double quest glory clan upgrade is overpowered and unbalances the game big time!

3995,sublimn,8,All expansions
3996,sucrates,7,"Solid game, but for all the things it has going for it (upgradeable race, nice miniatures, multiple ways to score points) it remains a king-of-the-hill style type of game with two main gripes:
- if you have a newbie on the table the player sitting clockwise from him is going to win the game as he basically has two piles to draft from
- sometimes you just don't get the cards you are aiming for but you realise it too late, being screwed before you even play that round. Of course, this is your own fault, but is it fun?

Won't mind playing this game, but much prefer Chaos in the Old World to which this game is often compared. I'm also surprised by the comparison as it feels more of a Nexus Ops with drafting. That being said, we have one non KS-copy in our gaming group, it is a solid game to play but quickly needs another expansion to really stay fresh. Or a KS copy which will cost an arm and a leg and then some. Not going that way."

4011,SunTzuArtOfWar,9,Amazing area control and card drafting game.  So fun to get the different monsters and the perfect length.  The only problem is the Loki strategy is kind of broken.  
4012,supadave2k1,9,"Brilliantly fun. Awesome theme, multiple ways to win (not just the Loki strategy). Works best with 3-4 players, not too bad 2p"
4013,Supah_Jawa,7,"Blood Rage is fun and fast, but it can often feel a little soulless. It strongly suffers from the issue of runaway leaders and the draft doesn't feel as vibrant after a handful of plays. Mechanically it all works, but I've never felt truly satisfied by this game."
4014,SuperArt,9.5,"This game is one of my favourites. Components are great, miniaturea awesome but the game itself makes this a 'must have'. Drafting mechanic is very nice since their are many different strategies to pick. This makes some less obvious choices the best card to draft. The battles are very dynamic since losing a battle can be a good thing. 
Some people complain about the Loki strategy to be unbalanced but this is simply not true.
My biggest con is that the game isn't very friendly to new players when there are more experienced players on the table. That said, the game is awesome in all other ways. Above con can be treated by showing the most important cards per ages, before you start drafting."
4015,superbit415,5,A decent enough area control deck/engine builder game. The problem is that some of the cards and combos are just broken. So the people who will pick it up will almost always win and there is nothing you can do to stop them.

The miniatures are awesome and give a good thematic level to the game. But in summary, I am playing it much less than I would like."

4025,Surge1000,7,"Pretty good game except for a couple features:  a player can fill a territory completely and own it round after round, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.  If they draft quests for it (which can just be lucky to get one from the first draw and otherwise requires opponents to hate-draft and weaken themselves as a result - i.e. the player that takes the quest and doesn't need it helps all of the other players to his own detriment) and have the late game Ragnarok zone, it can really be frustrating, again, because there's just nothing you can do about it, literally.

Otherwise, this is a very fun game.  The components are amazing (game is overproduced, imo, but still remarkable).  I'm happy to play it any time I'm asked, but I'm not likely to suggest it as my choice."
4026,Surged,5,"Was exciting to play at first, but then after several plays it began to feel as if you're locked into predetermined strategies."
4027,Surya,7,"tl;dr: an overproduced, more aggressive [thing=23985][/thing]

I always thought [thing=23985][/thing] was an underappreciated design. It is a very clean, streamlined area majority game. Thanks to this new implementation, it gets more attention. Too bad, in my opinion, they made the design less clean and made it more of a conflict game and less of an area majority game.
It is still a very good design, but it does move away from the aspects I respected the most about it.
The minis seem to be there mostly to sell more copies. They are very nice, but I would have preferred wooden pieces. Also, the minis sometimes make it hard to tell what figure you're looking at.
I haven't played Midgard in years, but playing this, I want to try it again.
As for this version: I wouldn't mind playing it again, but there's no way I'm paying for a copy of this version.

4038,sykano,7.9,"viking battle game

+ cool mythological viking Ragnarok theme, although a little bit depressing
+ nice mechanics (drafting, clan development, upgrades, quests, battle cards, losers keeps their battle cards, react to call for battle, action points as in ""Chaos in the Old World"", ...)
- the miniatures, though looking cool, are oversized for the game board and are basically unnecessary, make the game expensive
- a lot of the miniatures come warped, even big bases!
- impractical inserts, game materials don't fit back in box after usage
- very expensive
--- unavailable Kickstarter exclusives

The Kickstarter exclusives are super frustrating and annoying for normal buyers! If you hear about the game after the Kickstarter campaign is over, there is no chance to get the exclusives for a reasonable price. This is punishing customers for no reason!!
For ""Blood Rage"" (in contrast to ""Rising Sun"") I think, it is ok to live without the exclusives, but still very annoying.

Some combos can get out of hand much more than others if not everybody is careful during drafting. This can be a problem if less experienced players play with experienced players.

If you ask me, this is a much better game than ""Rising Sun"".

""Blood Rage"" has some interesting features:
- great theme
- action/interaction
- lots of tension (race for pillage rewards, area control for quests, age ends when all provinces are pillaged, call to battle, must play one battle card, limited upgrade slots, keep only one card between ages, action points like in CitOW, need to balance card types, ...)
- choice of strategy (drafting, clans identical at beginning but specialize, several viable strategies, Loki strategy, ...)
- catch up (loser keeps battle card(s), ...)"

However, if a person plays a key card, it can really cripple someone else and/or launch them ahead, which leaves me a bit cold. Still, it's thematic and plays fairly quick once everyone knows how to play, which is impressive for this genre."
4043,syphon,7,"A large improvement on Midgard. However, there's a missed opportunity here. Why not have the clans each have a base power of some sort which distinguishes them in a way other than just the sculpts of the miniatures?"

4047,s_craig_zahler,7,"Excellent miniatures and terrific art are the frosting on this game, which is a battle for glory. The unpredictable card element of a fantasy board game like Talisman is made more interesting here with a more immediate focus, multiple characters per player (leaders, warriors, sea ships, and monsters), more of a reliance upon strategy, and a board that evolves throughout the three different phases of play. Add to this the GREAT mechanic of self-sacrifice possibly working in a player's favor--and thus, a player's goals shifting mid-game or being hidden from others at first--and the resultant game has a lot of possibilities. This is not an analysis paralysis monster like Mage Knight (my favorite solitaire game alongside Thunderbolt Apache Leader and Perdition's Mouth), but there are often tough choices and gambles to be made.
A couple things are counterintuitive--I'd rather that warriors could not ""March"" to non-adjacent lands and the term ""Invade"" is not well chosen for landing new pieces on the board (""Invade"" sounds like an action that would occur after a ""March"")--but these are minor quibbles.
Overall Blood Rage is a really enjoyable game that has some of the immersive qualities of far heavier games while being fast moving, unpredictable, and a very good balance of luck and strategy. (One aside: In every instance that I can recall, the re-pillaging card massively warped the game in the card user's favor. I won't say that this card fully breaks the game--I can think of some theoretical ways around it--but it affects things more than any other card I've seen, by far, and I wish it weren't in mix.)
My favorite board game is Cave Evil while my girlfriend adores Pandemic, and Blood Rage is game that we both have a great time playing together. It is immediate, goal-driven fun and an engaging fantasy with lots of choices and great visuals."

I think the drafting mechanic is weak. I'm dubious that any designer could truly balance the breadth of mutually exclusive card combos, wherein you pluck cubes of bigger carrot from a boiling soup of goals and upgrades and battle prowess.

So the players meta-game the draft with an eye for diffusal, and we cobble a strategy out of the dregs. Then we resolve rounds of weird, stacked area-control poker. How does this fit the theme of glorious battle?"
4053,Taegukki,8.5,"Brilliant, swift gameplay, amazing miniatures and super brutal at times. An all around great area control game.

Art & Components: Art it´s cool, specially the minis (CMON always has good minis) I think the player´s mat are kinda cheap, I would rather have one like zombicide for example. I would have liked more details on the map but for the purpose of the game it´s ok. 

Gameplay: You can choose different strategies, controlling the areas, dying each round in an epic way and scoring (die in ragnarok and having the cards that let´s you score for each figure in valhalla), controlling monsters, upgrading your clan leader or the other generic guys without name etc. 

The not so good stuff: There is some kind of flaw when someone stays in a certain province and just scoring from quests related to region control in the entire game, you cannot interact with them if there are not slots available in that province but doesn´t harm the gameplay that much

Price: You get tons of cool minis so yeah, kinda pricey but fair I guess

***UPDATE 20190416**
The more I play this game, the more I like it. More than it´s territory control mechanic what I´ve been enjoying the most is surprisingly the draft part. I hate draft but on Blood Rage you can make quite different viable strategies that will make you feel each play different from the last one

4083,tayl0496,8,"It is a fairly straightforward game. Unlike many of my favorite games, I never find myself reflecting on a game of Blood Rage that I just played wondering ""what if I had done that?"" or ""what if I try such-and-such instead next time?""... I just don't think there is enough meat to the decisions in order to provide the kind of experience that would warrant this kind of reflection afterwards. 

Nonetheless, I love this game! It is a clean design that makes for a smooth playing experience with just enough tension and surprises. What this game lacks in strategic depth it more than makes up for in pure excitement. It is just so damn fun! After the first few games you know exactly what combos there are and the various strategies that exist, but it is still so fun to see how it plays out. I really don't know how to describe it.

NOTE: Everybody seems to think this game is all about the draft. I actually think the draft at the beginning of the round isn't that important. The key to the game lies more with timing. Knowing exactly WHEN to play a card seems more important to me than actually getting some of the supposedly overpowered combos."

4088,Teamjimby,7,"Blood Rage has gotten a lot of hype, and usually that makes me less likely to enjoy a game.  But, I was pleasantly surprised by it.  Blood Rage is really hard to classify.  It has area control and awesome miniatures, but also has action point allowance and drafting.  It's kind of a dudes on the map game, but there is so much more to it than just controlling territory.  I often dislike multiplayer area control games because of the politics/kingmaking, but Blood Rage avoids those pitfalls.

I went for a strategy that rewards you for losing battles, and I actually pulled out a solid victory.  I got points for losing battles, points for getting my guys killed, and I was able to place more guys whenever I lost a battle.  The fact that this strategy even exists boosted by rating by a full point.  Everything about the game was enjoyable and I didn't have any complaints.  I could see this rating rising if I get more plays.

UPDATE: My second play of Blood Rage was underwhelming, perhaps because it was only with 3 players.  Once again the strategy of losing battle dominated the game, although this time someone else used it.  There are a lot of great mechanisms put together in this game, but I'm not sure the sum of the mechanisms is something I enjoy.  I'd play it again, but never ask for it."

4120,TexJones,10,"This game is my favorite game currently. The ""combat"" reminds me of magic the gathering. The minis are the most detailed and original I've ever seen. If you're not into mini games don't let that turn you off. The minis aren't really necessary to the game play BUT they sure take the theme up to the highest level. This game is a lot more abstract than you would think just glancing at the box. My one gripe is there is a clan that consists only of women. They all are large-breasted with lot's of under-boob showing. We had to censor the artwork slightly to make it more family friendly. (My daughter is a bit of an artist and she did a good job)"

4133,The Barefoot Killer,8,"I think Blood Rage stands atop the mountain of bodies in a very competitive sub-genre of 90-120 minute dudes on a map bloodbaths.  This crowded field includes other great titles in recent years such as Kemet, Cyclades, and Cthulhu Wars (which definitely comes in fourth on this list).

What makes Blood Rage reign supreme is two-fold: 1) the card draw before each of the three rounds allows the players to develop and support flexible strategies, and 2) the tight geography and immediacy of conflict leads to plenty of bloodshed.  

The minis are fantastic, too, but all the games listed above have at least equal bragging rights in that department."

4135,the bored gamer,7.5,"This game is a lighter version of Chaos in the old world with the  most distinct difference being that there are no variable player powers (and of course the altered combat resolution). Which tickles a different player styles' fancy! 
In Citow your playstyle is prescripted according to the demon god you get and the associated deck of cards. In Blood Rage you can alter the playstyle to your liking according to the cards you pick in the draft. 
For instance, if you randomly assign roles in Citow and you draw Khorne you have to stick with a very aggressive playstyle to benefit from Khornes power. But there are people who just don't like to play agressive. They love to build up and defend. Others happen to hate this and love direct confrontation. Either way Citow maybe forces you to play in a way you don't enjoy. As said before in Blood Rage you can draft cards according to your ""liking"" and even change plans in between when you see that a specific route didn't work out. The advantage being that several routes can lead to succes, with the felt disadvantage being that maybe too many routes can lead to success and that in the end your plans - when working out - don't feel rewarding.

The presentation is exceptional--though quite a bit behind what I consider to be the vanguard of presentation in Scythe.  Art/bits are certainly eye catching, though there is a bit of trade off in the small cards and cardstock sideboards and player mats.

But:  gameplay is swift and intense.  Love the myriad of ways to play, but that can also lead to unforeseen surprises (I'm looking at you, Heimdall and Loki), and to well laid plans being laid to waste.

While Slow going for new players, it's best feature is experienced play can be fast... Matches can be greased lightning, under 20 min when everyone knows what they're doing... Better for multiple matches in one sitting though, since pull out and tear down is time consuming. Interesting mechanics, win by losing, be awarded for dying, and I always welcome draft mechanics. Really the big problem though is the game is fun, not great, and at 80 dollars, that feels like a waste."

My biggest criticism of Blood Rage is that with only three rounds, it it feels hard to come back from an early misstep.  That could be really cool with knowledgeable players, though...

Edit: Three rounds is plenty and some big comebacks are indeed possible.  I think the biggest reason I prefer CitOW is that I've felt it's harder to pursue a coherent strategy throughout the game.  I don't know if I really love the drafting. But, still, would play again."

4153,theaaron,10,"I have to join in on the unanimous praise for this game. It is excellent and I can't really see any negatives for now. The minis are fantastic, the gameplay is streamlined and simple to learn, a lot of cards feel overpowered but in a fun way. Awesome.

Still not sure where I'll land on Blood Rage versus Chaos in the Old World. CitOW is a solid 10 for me, but Blood Rage cleans up some of the fiddlier parts by just removing them completely (dominance, dial advancements, corruption, event tokens).

This game also has the advantage of playing with different player counts. It seems to be just as good with 3-5 players (skip it with two players). CitOW is really 4 players only, and I wouldn't even recommend the fifth player expansion for that game.

Great game, could possibly be a 10 after more plays.

Update: It's a 10. There's tons of tension in every move and so far it seems like different strategies can win.

I will say that the game definitely seems to be best with four players. Mechanically everything is fine with three players, but with four players you have more people going for different strategies and keeping each other in check.

So far I think that this game and CitOW offer different enough experiences to warrant owning both. Although a lot of the gameplay elements are the same, Blood Rage offers a ""choose your own strategy"" feeling, where CitOW gives you a strategy from the beginning based on which god you choose.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
Just not good with two players. You need players taking different strategies and keeping each other in check for the game to work, so the game is best with four, and good with three. With five it can be a bit long and harder to plan."

4158,TheBratPrince,8,"Blood Rage is bloody beautiful. The art of Adrian Smith has elevated this game and made me keep coming back for more. The production value of this monster is through the roof.
It is a simple enough game to explain and start playing with new people, even those who are not familiar with modern board games. Everything is straightforward, intuitive, written and easy to follow.
It is highly interactive and pretty unforgiving if you’re not paying attention to the other players’ agenda and tactics. If you let Loki do Loki things, you’re screwed Loki style. Some call this an issue with balance throughout the experience.
This is one of those games that will not have you win if you’re only looking at what’s the best move for yourself, but also what’s the best move against them. It sounds pretty cutthroat when written down like this, but that’s not really the case. You are Vikings. That’s what you do. You find glory in killing but in death too. You’ll adjust to this pretty quickly, especially that you have 3 ages to do so.
The more players the better, but it works well with 2. It’s just that you’ll add more cards and mini monsters/allies when playing with different numbers of people. 2 players having the least variety, but just enough for decent replay value.
It is highly thematic, from spending rage in order to do anything, over pillaging and killing, to holding a giant mini of a troll in your hand. Did I forget to mention Ragnarok and Valhalla? Well, that too."

I had decided to sell it, then I heard the Mystics expansion adds some needed variety. So that's where I'm at. I've got the Mystics expansion now and I need to try it once more with that.

I find this game to be pretty good but not great. The Loki strategy is a bit too easy (I won't say powerful but it is definitely easier than other strategies); it is the Khorne of Blood Rage. I usually love drafting but I don't think it helps in this game. The best drafter doesn't necessarily benefit; the person next to the worst / most inexperienced player definitely benefits. Maybe that is true of every drafting game, but when there's such a reliance upon card combos to hit OP status, existing knowledge of the cards trumps strategic play. Meh. Still though, I would rather play this, BY FAR, to a lot of other similar games, such as Rising Sun, Kemet, etc. "

4226,Thor80,9,"I really enjoy Blood Rage. Although it can have big changes in points, this adds to my enjoyment of the game as it can allow a trailing player to stay in the game through clever play using an alternative path to victory such as getting all of your dudes killed and scoring that way. Definitely better at higher player counts (4, 5) as I find in a 3 player game it is more difficult to reign in the first age leader. As with many ""plastic men on cardboard"" this is group dependent. Can be cleverly strategic but benefits from a group willing to interact with table talk and curtailing the leader. 
For new players it takes some time to learn the card combos when drafting. I usually point out several of the paths to victory, especially that a player can win by both successfully pillaging and by getting their figures killed and sent to Valhalla.

4236,Thunkd,6,"I had heard this game was the hotness, but it didn't really capture my interest. It's a direct conflict game and it's all about the miniatures, two things that don't really sell a game for me.

My play was colored by the fact that the rules explanation was all over the place. Some things were explained partially, then we'd switch to a new topic and only later would we finish the first part. Rules kept appearing with a ""Oh, I forgot... one more thing"". And another thing that colored the play for me was that the player explaining the game had played before and had memorized the cards, while the other two players were new.

The game has some interesting bits. It's essentially and area control-ish type of thing, where there's competition to be able to trigger fights in areas to get bonuses, which usually increase you ability to have more units on the board, get Vp's from fights, or take more actions. There's a draft before each of the three rounds, which factors into your ability to do things.

My main complaints about the game was that as a new player, you're at a disadvantage not knowing the cards, or how the game really works. And some of the cards seem really overpowered. There was one in particular that allowed a player to place a free unit whenever he brought a unit in that really seemed wonky.

It was interesting, but seemed to have some flaws, and wasn't really my thing."

4238,Tiamat,6,"It's not painful to play, so that's great.

A number of issues though. It seems like a game about conquering the map, but players seem reluctant to engage in battles they could lose; battles seem to mostly happen because as a defender you can't retreat units when somebody picks a fight.

The engine building is simple and doesn't seem to offer a lot of strategies. It also seems to create runaway leaders, partly because nobody sees it as a good idea to sacrifice their own plans just to make trouble for the leader.

The sense that the map matters is weakened by the unit movement action, which allows teleporting anywhere. Though, when someone starts an attack somewhere, other players have the option of moving in units from adjacent regions only."
4239,tibbles,6.3,"I liked the various strategy options and how losing fights was viable.  And I'm nearly always a fan of card drafting. 
 However, the game as a whole just didn't seem that good and the thing seemed massively over-rated as far as dudes-on-a-map go."

4246,TimTheTree,8,"So chances are if you're reading reviews about Blood Rage you kind of already know you want it. Admit it. Deep down the decision has already been made.

What you get in the box is the good kind of ridiculous. The minis by CMON are some of the best I've ever seen. Ever. The monsters are INCREDIBLE. It's so hard to pass up the chance to claim them in the game because few things feel better than clicking one of these beasties into your clan's ring and smashing it down onto the table. I wish I was talented enough to paint them in a way that would do them justice because hot. Damn. 

I really quite like Blood Rage's take on area control too, because everything is so fast and crazy and disposable. There isn't any turtling or slow play, because dagnabbit you're vikings and vikings wanna smash things and die gloriously. And with the scoring mechanics focusing on this idea, rounds can fly by blazingly fast. It is very rare for you to feel too upset about losing a battle due to the (sometimes broken) battle cards because:
a) every card and upgrade in this game feels equally, gloriously broken and
b) your units come back from Valhalla before you can say Yggdrassil. And they will probably score you points for doing so.

I've found that in most games under 4 players somebody unfortunately is wailed-on and put at *too* much of a disadvantage to really come back and challenge for the win. But Blood Rage is so fast and fun that this usually doesn't mar the experience too much.

It has been a tough call for me to choose between this and Inis as my favourite gorgeous-area-control-and-card-drafting game, but after many plays and much deliberation I am leaning more towards Inis as being the better of the two. 

But like I said, you know you already want this game. Come on."
4247,Tinman6,9,"I don't always want to table it and don't often get the urge to play it. However I've played it more than 20 times (which is a staggering number for our group). The only other game we'd have played this often is Terra Mystica. Anyway, it's always different and the more you know the more the game and drafting changes. Game keeps unfolding in new ways.  I always have fun playing it. Excellent, but doesn't fire me up in anticipation."

4249,tinyclanger,8,"This game is an exception to the general rule that retail editions of cmon (now no longer pronounced ""semen"" but ""come on"" instead) kickstarter games lack sufficient content to be fun. The retail edition of the game is great and kickstarter exclusives and expansions are by no means required for replayability.

Blood rage can be a very entertaining game. The game has fairly simple core rules which are modified by a set of cards. The cards are selected by a process of drafting, You have cards for combat, upgrading your core stats or adding new monsters to your army. The gameplay is really smooth and exploring card combinations is really interesting. It seems a reasonably deep game in that respect. It's definitely a game that rewards exploration of possible card combinations and is a lot more fun the once players become familiar with the cards. So it's at its best with experienced players.

The plastic miniatures seem almost superfluous as this is a very streamlined game about strategies rather than a traditional 'dudes on a map' game having lots of different unit types with differing abilities. The rest of the components aren't as great, just thin bits cardboard for the clan, game tracking and Valhalla, but these are all minor complaints, the game itself is great and I'm looking forward to playing again.

I ""deluxified"" my copy by purchasing thicker cardboard for the score track etc in the digital kickstarter campaign."
4250,Tiresias1066,8,"A really slick design from Eric Lang, one of my favorite designers! Drafting and putting combos together is gonzo fun. Some might be put off by the fact that this miniatures game is secretly a card game, but as an MTG kid, I love it.  I probably wouldn't love it if play time clocked in any longer, but it's breezily short.  Unfortunately, the whole thing is a little marred by the sexist aesthetics."

After all, the gameplay is largely similar to CITOW, but with drafting (a mechanic I love), scalability (CITOW should only be played with 4) and flexibility (no need adhering to a fixed strategy depending on the god you play). My first game of it was great, but also a little disappointing. Casual gamers found it to be harder than CITOW, because they found it hard to assess the relative worth of the cards going round. On top of that, the game feels more luck dependent, as some of the cards seem really strong and allow for some incredible combos. And since there are only three drafting rounds, it can be really hard to catch up with the leader after the first Valhalla fase. Finally, I personally found that the third round was not as interesting as the first two, as there was less to do with the shrinking board - cards get more powerful, but also more expensive. However, I still like the game and think it looks gorgeous - so I am curious to find out how my next game will go."

There are so many variables of strategy in this game that help balance it out. I LOVE being able to get more victory points than my friends without needing to win battles. That aspect alone is enough for me, but the viking mythology theme really comes through for me better than any theme of any other game I've played. I can imagine being a viking through this game.

The card drafting phase provides a great deal of tension as you try to balance the cost of allowing another great card slip into the hands of your opponents. The combat phase itself allows for a lot of room for decision making, and every turn feels just as impactful as the other. The way conflict is handled also allows for mind games, and Blood Rage makes it so that even losing can have its perks. That being said, certain aspects of Blood Rage can be very swingy, and a few cards feel significantly better than others leading to a small imbalance that nullifies certain strategies. That being said, I love Blood Rage, and I look forward to playing many more games in the future."

4317,Trevor03,5,"After so long, finally got a chance to play this! Streamlined, intuitive gameplay, great minis, plays pretty quick... this all should add up to an awesome experience. 

But... when a game asks you every turn ""do you want to do the COOL and EXCITING thing, or the drab boring thing that gets you points?"" it feels a bit unsatisfying. 

I was dominating our game, 30-40 points above everyone going into the last round by barely engaging in battle (and purposely losing), playing almost nothing but quest cards, and waiting until everyone else used up their rage to complete a few quests by playing single warriors.

In the last round I had similar options, but felt unsatisfied, so brought one of the awesome minis into the mix, had epic battles with everyone, lost some, but it was super exciting.

Lost the game because of it. Admittedly this is from a single game, but two other players agreed it seemed the ""less fun"" choices were ultimately what wins you the game. Would like to try again to see if I'm wrong."

The first plays were a lot better but I reckon that the replayability is just not given in this game because it is very obvious that some cards are extremely stronger than other ones. That has the negative effect of predicting the winner of the game.
Aside from that, the game is pretty enjoyable although it is quite repetitive in its actions, in the end there is not much variability.

I miss the feeling of area control and tech building some... This game is almost purely attacking, but there are a TON of tactics and strategy to your actions.

My big complaint is how swingy the game is, you really  never have any idea who is winning as someone can come out of nowhere with 60-80 points on any age.  It's also perhaps a bit too crazy? Not as crazy as Cosmic Encounter, you can learn what the power moves are, but it can be really hard to guess what your opponent is up to.  The game can be really punishing if you make one bad move so it's almost stressful in that way to the point where it's almost stressful to play.  You might have a set of actions in your hand, a plan in your head, suddenly places are getting ransacked faster than you expected, there's no time to do everything you wanted to do! Tough decisions is the name of this game, to a painful degree.

All-or-nothing combat resolution systems like this one usually lead to pile-on-the-leader slugfests that devolve into horrendously long drags, but this game neatly avoids the problem by giving a lot of incentive to move around and cards that progressively get better as the game moves along.  It's a tough problem to solve, and the fact that this game has done so is admirable.  But then I'm left pretty cold by the whole experience.  The theme here is supposedly viking, but the execution of the thematic flourishes feels like it could be set in any of a number of other generic universes.  Euros have gotten flak for Egypt=Italy=Netherlands=... themes with no real difference, but it's getting to the point where Ameritrash is falling into the same traps, but instead with Viking=Fantasy=Warhammer=... themes.  I'm not going to insist on something else if this comes out, but I'm not super excited to play it either."

Yes you can win by losing battles (making it an interesting decision to join a battle or not) and some cards allow for wildly powerful combos.

So very appropriately, card drafting is the core mechanism which drives the epic, build your own special powers engine dudes on a map game that is Blood Rage.

Over three ages players have to make agonising decisions to choose between the many cool special powers and quests to put together an efficient combat engine. The viking clans and their house-trained giant monsters then slug it out for glory in the provinces around Yggdrasil while the whole world is falling apart in Ragnarok. ""We need a bigger Valhalla"". The casualties pile up high in Valhalla, often with a sneaky happy grin on their players' faces as they wanted them to be slaughtered in battle for the glory of being resurrected from Valhalla at the end of each age.

Very good, in your face confrontational game with lots of hard choices to be made throughout and with great miniatures (bigatures?/maxiatures?). Highly recommended Eurotrash game. Definitely a keeper to sit proudly next to Kemet and Cyclades.
"
4439,Velcro10w,8,"'Blood Rage' is an excellent game, themed on the Norse gods' final battle with the giants of Jontheim and the God of Mischief; Loki. Each player takes on the role of one of up to four clans who are vying to improve their prestige, through earned glory (victory points), by conquest and strategy. The clans start with a leader and four warriors, and can utilise these in a number of ways using rage as the resource to do so, which along with glory and horns, are the three abilities that need to be increased to achieve more glory. There are three turns, consisting of card selection, actions including battle and pillaging, and finally Ragnarok itself. Players take one of eight cards at the beginning of each turn, selecting one and then passing the balance on to the player to their left, until the final two for each player are placed in the discard deck. Any unused cards, during the turn are also discarded, bar one, before the next selection round apart from turn three of course at the end of which Ragnarok is well and truly here! The cards contain things such as battle bonuses from allies, clan upgrades, like improved combat effectiveness, monsters, quests and ship upgrades. Most of these have rage point costs, that must be paid to acquire, being then placed in the clan player board (homeland). There are several realms surrounding Yggdrasil, and one of these is destroyed by placement of a Ragnarok counter, and three more of these will be destroyed in each of the three turns, in accordance with the predetermined draw. This needs to be watched, as players may not necessarily want their forces to be destroyed in the cataclysm!, although certain cards actually encourage this as bonus glory can be earned for this and/or retrieving warriors from Valhalla right at the end of each turn. When cards are utilised subsequently, the rage cost must be paid, and bear in mind (as I failed to do on one occasion), that quests must all be placed before the clan rage pool is exhausted. There are no limits, apparently, to the number of quests that may be placed, although having these does limit options in other areas such as clan upgrades! Gaining higher levels of rage, glory and horns yields glory at the end of the game. I should comment that raising glory increases the glory earned in each battle that is fought and horns increase the number of warriors (there is a maximum of eight) and/or your one leader and/or your one ship that can be placed. in the game we played, Endof Supercycle won following the strategy of sending and retrieving warriors from the halls of Valhalla whereas Rod Chapman collected bonus glory for ending the game with all of his pieces on the table. Both of these were generated by specific clan upgrades which can be played to any clan so long as the player has drawn the card in the first instance. There were no KRO's and the game was well explained by Jim Boardgames. I would make only two observations and that would be that when a pillage attempt is made, each player in turn sequence declares if one of their clan (only those in adjacent realms) wishes to invade. (The number of invading pieces is limited by the number of available unoccupied spaces). And secondly, when any upgrade card is played, each player confirms what it is once, as it is difficult and delays the game if players have to lean over and inspect cards each time they are about to take an action. Should they then forget later, tough cheddar! On further reflection, I wasn't sure why there was a limitation on potential realm spaces as there are none for Yggdrassil itself and each clan is still limited by their overall clan size as mentioned before. I wasn't clear why ships could not move after placement and would be looking for an explanation from the game designer although the expansion(s) may change this arrangement perhaps. Nevertheless, it didn't detract from my enjoyment, even though I gained least glory, and was last. That's the difference between a good and poor game in my view."

4442,Vendalmis,9.5,Epic. Played several 2 player games and loved it. Had some friends over for a 4 player game and we were blown away. The example I give friends is that it reminded me of the old PC Lan parties I use to attend where we'd play then spend another hour after the fact just relishing in what took place and talking about the strategies and incredible moments throughout. Blood Rage delivers a simple yet immersive experience that so far no other game in my collection has matched.
4443,Vendeseba,8,"After a couple of games I ve found that this game is so limited in strategies and very card driven. It´s a card game with miniatures to resume with a few words. 
 The game has a counter intuitive style when sometimes (with the cards that allow it) you have to loose battles or complete easy objetives that have a minor interaction between players (control of zones)."

The theme is perfect. There are many high detailed minis, cool artwork and gameplay really reminds me a real battle between clans with Ragnarok in the background. 
Sometimes we use all of the cards, even if we are playing just in couple ;) It's more random and often makes funny situations, but it's still good. You can try it ;)"
4446,VepsoO,7.62,"It is so elegant and simple really, but still provides that epic feeling you should get of a game of this size. Card drafting is one of my favourite mechanics, and the 7 wonders style drafting works well here. It's tough decision making, but no matter what cards you get when you draft, you can always try to make some sort of strategy out of it. I try not to think of this as an area control game, more of a victory point grabbing game, where you try to maximize your return of your actions. One problem with the game, it can suffer from a runaway leader problem. 

Overall I game I enjoy - but there are other area control games I enjoy more - and also other purer card drafting games I enjoy more - therefore this was eventually sold off. "
4447,verandi,5,"Played a few times. What I like: there is good decision angst, both in the card drafting and action phases. What I don't like: there's just too many vp opportunities flying around. I was hoping there'd be more interaction with players fighting over scraps; instead, I've found the game too self-involved as players are more attentive to the card combos in their hands than each other. There's just too many cards of the ""score x points for having y"" variety, e.g. in my last game I drafted a card that gave me 12 VP if my boat was destroyed. Getting the boat destroyed was a trivial, uninteresting task that got me beaucoup points without any prior planning or overarching strategy. That's how much of the game starts to feel: why bother guessing which scoring card the other guy has and trying to stop it when you've got your own scoring card to fulfill."
4448,VerbalKint,7,Great area control with a large amount of strategy. Being rewarded for dead Vikings is a fresh concept. Numerous ways to acquire points. I really enjoy this game.

4473,vladdswrath,7,"A prettier, more exciting version of Midgard, Eric Lang's 2007 Z-man release. It plays pretty much the same, except that there is a bigger focus on combat and the entire game has been reconfigured to accentuate that. It's hard not to love the new version, as the miniatures are tremendously well done and the whole production pops, especially when compared to the quaint wooden pawns and one dimensional decision making of the original.

Still, while I think it is more engaging than the original, I'm not sure it has legs. The decks from which you draft cards are tiny in number, which means you see the exact same cards almost every game. That may be a positive for game balance, but it sure seems like it will get repetitive after a few plays. There is also a degenerate tactic (at least it feels that way) of shoveling guys into the doomed Raganarok spaces, just to convert them into almost instant points. While marching off to Ragnarok is thematically appropriate, it feels cheap to intentionally avoid battles in order to gain better position for a mass suicide.

I can't in any way say this is a bad game, but I will say there are too many counter-thematic ""gamey"" moves for me to ever consider it a good one. Maybe if I was a painter, my opinion could be swayed a bit. I have to say the miniatures are fantastic. I suppose the gameplay is good enough, when it's all said and done."

Another great thing about Blood Rage is that unlike many area control games it works very well with every player count (it's good with 2, very good with 3 and great with 4!). And it packs all that intense action into a 60-90 minute gaming session. 

[b]/update, June 2018:[/b] Downgraded from 8 to 7. After seven plays some things about it started to rub me the wrong way. There's something  a bit unsatisfying about the way the points are scored in this game. The scoring ramps-up towards the end and the swings can be ridiculous and hard to predict. Blood Rage is almost a ""point salad"" type of area control and I don't know if I like this lack of focus all that much. Also, I hate situations when your opponents manage to abuse certain cards allowing to steal your last precious rage points. When this happens you are prematurely of the round - you just sit at the table doing nothing and waiting for others to finish their turns. 

I still think that this is a good game, but my desire to play it over other games in this genre has diminished over time.

4529,Webhead123,8,"In many ways, Blood Rage feels like a spiritual successor to Chaos in the Old World. This shouldn't really be that surprising when you realize that Eric Lang designed both games.

In that regard, Blood Rage stands out above CitOW for me because of some of the new elements that it adds. Players now draft hands of cards at the start of each round. Combat is driven by a Cosmic Encounter-like card system instead of dice. Players will have a variety of methods for gaining victory points depending on the cards they drafted, which will skew the way they deploy their troops to the board.

Blood Rage also keeps several of the interesting facets of CitOW: alternate routes to victory, upgrading your army, area control and keeping your opponents in check.

Blood Rage is also more flexible in player count than CitOW. 4 is probably still best but the game still works fine with 3 and even pretty well with 2 players.

Blood Rage does what a good spiritual sequel should and being built on a game that is solid to begin with only makes it great."

I’d love to give a play-by-play, but my memory is terrible, however I’ll try to give a general gist of how I played. I managed to draft the clan upgrade that allows you to play a warrior for free whenever you place another figure in a region. Later, I got the warrior upgrade that makes a pair of them worth 3 strength, so I had that synergy. In addition, I also had the clan upgrade that gave me points for figures released from Valhalla, so dying was no longer a big concern. I combined that with the quest to have a certain number of figures in Valhalla to pull out the win.

I love games with asymmetry, whether that’s built-in from the start with games like Chaos in the Old World or whether it’s earned over the course of the game like in Kemet or Blood Rage. The added wrinkle of drafting those differences and trying to create interesting combinations was a lot of fun, and I’m surprised no one had tried it before.

I’m happy I backed this one on Kickstarter and I look forward to playing it a lot more in the future.

Highly recommended if you enjoy confrontational games."

Finally, goals are evaluated, another province is destroyed, and any destroyed figures are released from Valhalla. The game plays well and the minis look really cool.

Now all that out of the way, I would say I really liked this game. It’s pretty fast paced and I love the card drafting at the beginning. The minis look great as with any CMON game if you are familiar with them. What really surprised me though was how easy this game was to learn. I looked through the manual as I was setting the game up for the first time and by the time I had the game setup I pretty much knew how to play, 20 minutes tops. I referenced back a couple times for specific things but the player boards and the turn tracker board pretty much explain everything you need to know right there. Not my favorite area control style game but for sure in my top 3 of that genre. 

Negative Final Thoughts –

If I were to point out something I don’t like about the game I guess it would be that there is a max of 4 players out of the core box. This is of course alleviated with the expansion for a 5th player but I absolutely hate the way a lot of game companies are releasing an extra player as basically board game DLC and charging for it. You can see this with Rising Sun as well, another CMON game. That said, if you usually play with 4 or less then this game works perfect out of the box.

4554,Wigdogger,9,"A very thematic experience. The great minis and board really bring the game to life.

The card drafting works really well, as you can build your combos from one age to the next. Even though the deck is barely over 100 cards, there is a lot of a variety in what can come out and how you can plan your strategy. Love all of the upgrade paths that are possible. Some of the mid-game and late-game gambits and showdowns provide lots of drama, too.

The game is a bit long at five players, and there can be a disparity in endgame scores when people are learning, but when you have a group willing to put in the time, it's fun stuff."

Positives: The models, some of the best out there and once painted make the game a joy to watch/play. The variety of playing styles, it encourages participation whether you win or lose! It is easy to learn but has depth to master. It can vary tremendously using the Gods expansion. 

Negatives:  Experienced players will run over new players until they learn the combos of cards and strategies. Runaway victories are possible. Sometimes forced to hate draft to stop opponents dominating. Some criticize the female models gratuitous clothing 

Conclusion: Excellent card drafting area control game with a real well developed theme and components

I think this is one of the few games that deserves the hype that surrounds it. It’s just a really good game, the drafting is fun and not just tacked on, the idea of manipulating someone because you want them to over-commit to a battle, killing all your warriors, just to reveal a card that states that’s great news for you is a blast, the components are great, easy to follow rule book, it’s just the complete package, will definitely be playing lots more of it in the future."

4588,WookieeLove,8,"I think Blood Rage deserves to be as popular as it is.  There is plenty of strategic depth to be had and lots of fun to be extracted through experimenting with and adapting different strategies.  Wonderful moments of tension can culminate in dramatic surprises in the epic battles which tend to unfold in the Yggdrasil province.  People that suck at strategic combat can even pull out decisive victories by losing on purpose, thanks to the Loki card realm.  As is common knowledge, the production values are top notch, and the theme is fun, well represented, and synergizes well with the gameplay.  

That all being said, the game definitely has some flaws.  The drafting mechanic has little strategy to it beyond ""grab the cards that fit MY strategy, if possible, faster than anyone else does,"" with the only curve ball being ""this card doesn't really fit my strategy but I feel I have to take it so that the next player doesn't get to capitalize on it.""  Players can also be steamrolled if they fall significantly behind on their ""Rage"" stat and simply don't have the economy to take as many actions as other players later in the game.  

Despite its flaws, Blood Rage deserves a place in history as one of the best ""dudes on a map"" games, and a place on your shelf as a game which will most likely be enjoyable for all players that enter your home, new and veteran alike.  "

Then you play them to move plastic around the map (with combat a bit like the game of thrones boardgame) deciding which leading opponents you want to butt heads with. You also get some fun tech tracks to raise. It plays lightning fast. Like most of these card passing games you fight more against what randomness gives you than each other making this a safe game for those who are combat averse, but also failing to have as great a punch if its direct competition you are looking for.

I find other games where strategies you select to pursue are not dependent on random factors but player design vastly superior. In the end what you have here is a single hand of poker that takes two hours to play."

In general it feels a little unbalanced with some card that appears nearly always better than others, farming resources input doesn't always reward you and Loki cards are really annoying to play with and against.
The game wants you to fight, so you'd think to boost up your troops but in the meantime a Loki strat that consist in losing and taking back minis, and gaining points for basically wasted cheap warriors in fights you know you're gonna lose seems more efficient like 9/10 times. This adds some ""funny"" stuff to the game that can be good for new players but after a while it just bores you because it makes you choose sub-optimal cards for your draft. As result it always ends beeing kinda worthless.

4608,Xanhast709,8,"Ill break my commentary down based on the player counts Ive had:

2 player: Had 2 games at two players, didnt mind it at two but both plays had a clear runaway winner, but both games at this count were learning games one for me and the other for someone I introduced the game to. Still feels pretty competitive at 2 and games are usually about a hour or so in length decent at this maybe a few more players would be better..

5 Player:  Absolute carnage and chaos, especially in the later ages, the first age saw a lot of the players take early pillages to get the stat pumps and try to avoid incursions, most of the first age was a ramp up to the last two where it was almost kemet like with players decimating each other for vps and pillage blocks. It is Much harder to pillage in the later ages of the game if you dont have a significant force, and getting multiple pillages is doable but maybe more of a pipe dream. The game took a very long time though at this player count so I feel maybe one less player would be ideal, but I wont turn down a game with 5 in the future."

4633,YamiNoSenshi,9,"A dudes on a map game for 2-4 people. Players draft a hand of cards, then compete as viking tribes to raid and pillage as the world ends. The winner is the person with the most glory at the end of 3 rounds."
4634,Yanastos,9.5,"There are so many different strategies in this game that you never truly know who will come out victorious. Viable winning options include winning clan battles, controlling multiple areas, and completing quests. Even dying or losing battles is a great winning strategy if you draft the right cards. 

The miniature figures are really nice, and even more incredible when painted. I would like to get more plays of this to hammer down some other strategies. Really really good action point and area control game that has a great wargame theme and feel."
4635,yankeezulu,3,"A friend brought Blood Rage over for our regular games night and it was a very strange gaming experience. I lost a battle early in the 1st Age, which didn't seem like a problem until I realised that that one battle had basically knocked me out of the game. Don't get me wrong, I tried my best to get back into it, but all my efforts were futile and served only to ensure that my last place points tally wasn't too far behind the other players. My game was in marked contrast to the player that won, who was racking up huge scores for fun, despite not having done a great deal more than anyone else to earn the points. I'm not sure what this game is supposed to be, or who it's supposed to be aimed at. The gameplay seems quite limited and it doesn't make a great deal of sense thematically: the chrome really only serving to hide what is, at heart, a pretty basic area control game with a weak combat mechanic layered on top. After playing I checked on BGG and was quite surprised to see that it's ranked 23. I thought it was fairly poor and with a bit of tweaking could have climbed up to 'okay', but in no way could it be described as the 23rd best game in existence. It's certainly not in my top 23 and probably wouldn't make it into my top 23 games with blood in the title."

4670,Zafin,8.6,I got my copy of Blood Rage in June 2016. It's such a fantastic game! I love the area control and hand management aspects of the game. I love the Viking them. It's also cool that you can win by either your units dying a lot or killing a lot of enemies. This is by far one of my favorite games.
4671,Zakalwe_Zwakh,7,"Solid fusion of Euro-style mechanics with dudes-on-a-map warfare. Unfortunately this very same fusion and the game's theme tends to lend itself to an odd bit of dissonance.

The game's meta is almost counter-intuitive. You'd think a game about vikings duking it out in the end of days would reward players for martial prowess. Rather, if you want to do best in this game, you'll find flambeing your own troops for Glory and hoarding Quest Cards will do you better than almost ever winning combats. This can be particularly deflating when you plot and bluff your way to winning a massive battle, only for the one person not involved to casually burn away their troops to score maybe triple what you got for squashing the other two players.

Those wonky vibes aside, the game is mechanically interesting, with the draft in particular providing some fun moments of second-guessing and planning. The production is solid too, with the miniatures being a particular highlight. The board, which resembles a map from the [i]Total Annihilation[/i] computer game franchise...not so much. The fantasy Viking theme ties in well with the mechanics of heroic death and hacking your foes to pieces while not having as many awkward theme-missteps as [i]Rising Sun[/i] does.

Speaking of RS, I'd give this a slight edge over it on the basis of it being, for me, more fun. It doesn't overstay its welcome, and mechanically seems far more focused than its unwieldy sibling. I'd recommend this if you love vikings, miniatures and somewhat unconventional warfare. Not so much if you're looking for a good ol' hack and slash skirmisher. Less a mosh pit, more a cold war.

4690,Zedsdead,5,"I've only logged one play but it wasn't a very good experience.  I respect the attempt: the figures are awesome, the ability to recruit monsters and upgrade your warriors is great, and the Norse mythology theme is terrific.  

But Blood Rage does little to solve the problems inherent to all targeted-attack games: Player A expends resources effing up Player B, and Players C and D are the ultimate winners of the exchange.  That's just not fun for me no matter which of those four players I am.  Plus it incentivizes politicking and whining."
4691,ZeeDeveel,10,"Current Feeling: Phenomenal. It wasn't quite what I was expecting but it provides a very deep experience both thematically and strategically without taking too long to setup, play or explain. Be warned this is not the game you expect. It's more a strategy game than a wargame, it has no economy, no empire building and area control is fleeting. It features a shifting map where control swings like a pendulum, where you'll not always have a board presence. There are multiple paths to victory, the losing player can grasp victory from the jaws of defeat with a cunning final gambit. It is very satisfying.

Initial Impression: Slightly odd mechanics that I wasn't expecting. It's not very wargamey, doesn't feel like you're capturing territory or fighting a war. The board is very claustrophobic and gets smaller as the game progresses. Pieces don't move around very much... it's just very odd, but really fun and satisfying with a lot of thinking. Thoroughly enjoyable!"

After seriously disliking some of Lang's other games it is good to know that I can just avoid anything with his name on it. Especially as the cost of entry via CMON is stratospheric and I can buy 4 or 5 better games for the cost of one CMON game."
