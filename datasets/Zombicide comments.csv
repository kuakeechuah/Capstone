New Rating: 6/10

Zombicide is a game where I feel like the mechanics need just a bit more thought to really be compelling.  While there's some amount of fun to be had in mindlessly gunning down endlessly spawning zombies, the charm soon wears thin for me.

For example, the idea of searching in Zombicide feels hollow - you could endlessly search in a single room every turn and keep finding more stuff.  This means that exploration is generally kept to a minimum and only when needed to snag an objective.  In addition, searching is extremely hit or miss.  You might search on your first time and find a chainsaw or a shotgun.  Or you might search 6 or 7 turns in a row and find only useless stuff like rice or spare ammo.  Not so much fun when you only start with a frying pan!

I don't really mind the rule where you always shoot survivors first when firing into a zone containing zombies and survivors, but it does feel kind of hamfisted.  Nobody wants to kill their friend, so I think a better rule would be to randomize a chance to shoot your allies or the zombies.

The game becomes such a slog in the mid to end game because such a huge number of zombies are spawning that you're constantly just rolling dice and taking generic walkers off the map only to have them respawn at the end of the turn.  This turns the fighting into a chore after a while and sometimes you feel like you're really making no progress.

Still, the game does manage to have its fun moments sometimes.  There is some fun to be had when making a clutch roll to save an ally or when you ""level up"" and pick up a new skill to make your character more lethal.  While the skills are generally pretty generic, it's still fun to have a way to upgrade your character based on what your equipment looks like.

Overall,  I'd say Zombicide is a solid game when you're looking for some middle ground between a bunch of new gamers and some more veteran gamers looking for something with a bit of challenge to it.

PROS:
+ Simple to play and straight forward.
+ Everyone ""gets"" the Zombie Apocalypse.  A space with 10 walkers on it is scary and exciting.
+ The Modular board allows for varied scenarios without having a ton of components.

CONS:
- A simple mistake can result in a player death pretty early.  Player Elimination is definitely a present danger and having somebody die early can really be a bummer when the games can last 2 to 3 hours or more.
- Simple dice rolling mechanic for combat can become a chore when fighting large quantities of zombies.
- Searching mechanic leaves something to be desired."
20,AdamStarks,5,"Decently fun, with nice components and some interesting mechanics, but the rules can be a little esoteric to explain (such as how Cars and Manholes work, or justifying how you shoot your friends before any zombies), and sometimes bad fortune just grinds you down regardless of the decisions you make."
21,Adanedhel,2,"Muy típico, coger armas para tirar dados, matar zombis, cooperativo... En fin, el juego a parte de que me parece aburrido, creo que es muy básico y muy caro para lo que es, y que no aporta nada al mundo lúdico, hay juegos de zombis muchísimo mejores. Entiendo que pueda gustar a gente que no conoce más juegos, pero no es mi juego ni tampoco lo recomendaria a nadie habiendo otros de la temática mil veces mejores y mas divertidos."

60,alenen,6,"This game was fun, and better put together than Last Night on Earth. I'm actually impressed, as this was originally a kickstarter, and that's usually a bad thing. The game is decent, the rules are fairly straightforward. The theme is implemented well.

What held me back from a higher rating is that I am not a huge zombie fan, so the games around that theme don't draw me in. There are a couple of rules, like the car movement rule, that don't exactly make sense.

If this is suggested, I'll play it, as I want to play it a second time before I confirm that it's a 6, but I probably won't request it on my own."
61,alepsycho,5.5,"A fine game in this theme, I don't have too much to say about it, it is simple and very generic, but with good resolution in the dungeon aspect.

Looks good for a simple co-op zombie game.

Production value is top notch. Beautiful minis, especially the zombies.

I do see the co-op part could make or break the game depending on who the gamers are. 

The addition of weapon cards adds great flavour on the player mat. Battle is simple and populating the city with zombies was done very well.

Its an OK gameplay wise, for me at best.

Getting tired with zombie themed games. Zombies in the city, in towns, in malls, in zombieland, my back yard, etc. kill'em with guns, knives, baseball bats, chainsaw, spoon, kitchen sink, etc. 

This (game) will probably bring an end to my interest in zombie games.

69,Alienmastermind,9,"Well - with six players, we beat the first scenario in about three hours. With careful planning; using the 'make noise' option to maximum effect - making sure that we spent the first few rounds searching the first building and arming up before leaving -- we won. 

Now, we did have a character suffer a wound due to some bad rolls, but we lucked out at the beginning and pulled two Molotovs, and I was playing the dude who automatically gets two of any weapon and I got the SMG right away."

I really enjoy the feeling of thinking I'm on top of everything, and then seeing my fortune tumble in a matter of minutes, as my survivors get swarmed and eaten by an ever-increasing mob of undead. Not as good as Last Night On Earth story-wise, but more satisfying action-wise. A pleasant surprise. And oh, the bits...

As the name implies, there's very little horror and a lot of zombie-shooting, zombie-smashing, and zombie-chainsawing.  As a Left 4 Dead player, I approve.  The rulebook isn't great, and there are some minor rules ambiguities, and some rules I just don't care for, but it's FUN, dammit.  Too many tiny plastic zombies for it to not be.

EDIT: Really wish they had rules for playing with 7 or more players for us Kickstarter folks.  I've got 9 heroes, with more on the way, but the game gets too easy if I play with more than 6?

EDIT: OK, the first rating (8) was good for the first scenario, but after playing a few of the others, going to have to downgrade this a bit.  Scenario 1 has you scavenging around a town for necessary foodstuffs to help the group last in the post-apocalyptic world.  It's hard, and tense, but in the way that all good co-ops are hard. It's also a very long scenario.

After trying several other scenarios, it almost feels like Scenario 1 was the one that the game was built for, and the rest are all afterthoughts.  Afterthoughts that have neither the challenge nor the fun factor of the game we thought we were playing.  I'll try the rest of them, since I've seen the game's potential. I'm keeping an eye out for fan-built scenarios, and might build some of my own, but some of these scenarios that come with the game are just poorly designed."

Even a majority of the rules work very intuitively - how zombies move, how people move, what people can do, etc. There are two big flaws about it though - while the majority of the rules work well, there are a handful that work but come across as non-intuitive or un-thematic (targeting priority and driving cars, namely). The second flaw is that the rulebook scenario's are not very well balanced or diverse.

Ultimately, what I love most about this game is the sandbox nature. Even though the the rulebook scenarios are all rather similar, just the tiles and stuff you get is enough to play great games for a long time, especially with houserules."

Toxic City Mall and Angry Neighbors are my choices for the two best expansions, based on the additional characters and weapons that come with those.  The dog companions also make for a nice touch, as are any number of the individual characters that can be purchased individually on eBay.

Since buying it, I regretted not jumping in on the Kickstarter and getting all the extra pieces (although we just created our own versions of them and printed their player cards from the GG website).

178,BabyAzerty,3,"This game suffers from the leadership syndrome where, even if you play with 4 people, it feels like the only one to play is the most knowledgable player.

The different characters are well designed and make heavy allusions, but it's mostly cosmetic.

The game starts hard, where luck is an important aspect; and once you are well equipped, the game feels easier...

It can also feel repetitive unfortunately... But you have a lot of scenarios which try to renew each game. I still find it repetitive... Just like in (MMO)RPG video games where you have thousand of different quests with different stories but they are basically all about going to A and collect B.

Avoid this game at all cost if you don't want to suffer from the leadership syndrome."
179,bad1788,8.99,"Dynamic game play with multiple variable missions for fun zombie co-op fun.

Game is challenging as players start off defenseless and level together to battle hords of zombies. Variety of characters, expansions, missions, maps and objectives really helps round out the experience and make the game feel fresh.

Humor is spot on and timely.

Pro:
Great components
lots of unique characters (and celebrity add on packs)
Miniatures! are nicely made and art is colourful and engaging
variation of play! With missions and character abilities and random spawns different objectives the game has lots of replay ability
Noise making mechanic adds dynamic to the game (not something I've seen in other mission based co-op games)

Con:
Longer set up time
Cost (she is a bit pricey but I think well worth it)
Table Captain syndrome exists as more experienced players can run the board

Miss-able turns: There are times in the game when a player (or multiple players) have to idle their turn. Either the situation/objective or other character abilities mean that players are unable to really move or go anywhere without actually hurting the team. I've played games where I had to skip my turn for 4 rounds in a row because we would make too much noise. So keep that in mind

All in all, I would still love to own this game and some expansions. I would caution folks to look into each season as everyone will have their favorite and I don't think all character packs are necessary (although they are neat!)"

188,balijan2,7,"Volt szerencsém a kipróbáláskor egy szinte teljes Zombicide kollekciót megnézni, nagyon impozáns látvány! Aki figurafestésre adja a fejét, annak nem ezzel a gyűjteménnyel kell kezdenie:) Nagyon ráfeküdtek a szerzők, amennyit láttam belőle, az alapján tényleg kihozzák a témából a maximumot. Még könyveket is kiadtak hozzá... Aki erre rácuppan, a végtelenségig játszhat vele: sok tucatnyi pályaelem, több száz figura, kártya lett hozzá kiadva, térfogatra kb. 8-10 alapjátéknak felel meg a teljes gyűjtemény (és még nincs vége szerintem). Tényleg egy külön kis univerzum.

És hogy a partinkról is essen szó: Ebben a műfajban talán ez a játék tetszett eddig a legjobban! A szabályrendszer a kategóriához képest nagyon egyszerű. Nem tököltek mindenféle sebzés-tokenekkel, a játékosoknak csak 2 élete van, a zombik pedig egyenesen fogyóeszközök:) Tucatjával lehet ölni őket (a sláger a kocsival való gázolás volt) és tucatjával is teremnek újra minden sarkon vagy a csatornában. Ennek megfelelően a győzelem vagy vereség nem nüanszokon múlik, hanem ha nem bírunk velük, előbb-utóbb ellepnek minket a zombik... Nem azt mondom, hogy a kedvencem lesz, de ha ilyen típussal kellene játszanom, ezt választanám, mert pl. a pálya összeállítása nagyságrendekkel egyszerűbb, mint egy Odalentben vagy főleg Earth Rebornban, és vannak egész rövid pályák is, ha arra van igény. Ha több dobozt is megpiszkálunk a nagy gyűjteményből, akkor azért elég horror lehet az elpakolásnál szétválogatni hogy mi hova tartozik... 
A játékban a nehézségi szintet elég lazán oldották meg: egyfelől minden pályának van egy ""hivatalos"" nehézsége, másfelől ha több szereplőt viszünk, akkor könnyebb a játék. Tehát lehet akár mindenki két emberrel és akkor dupla annyi akciónk van. Így elég könnyű belőni magunknak a testhezálló nehézségi szintet.
Aki szereti ezeket a mászkálós-lövöldözőseket, az mindenképp próbálja ki!"

I like playing it with my friends, but it wears on me.  The game allows for customization which is good to see because I feel no need to play a scenario twice.  It includes a campaign mode that has zero depth.  You just play the maps in a row.  I enjoyed my first plays greatly, but subsequent games became more boring.  At least it's co-op."

211,bbhalla,6,"Initial Impression: For some reason, this game left me feeling the same way that I felt after having played Call of Cthulhu. Both have a reliance on many decks of cards to generate the body of the story. The game art was thematic and the minis were a great addition to the theme. However, the game felt more tactical, almost like the heroes were an elite commando team rather than a scattered group of survivors, and there wasn't much of a sense of overall urgency or dread. Overall, this seemed like a more mid-complexity dungeon crawl rather than a zombie apocalypse survival horror."
212,BCush,9.5,"This is the game I want to have and play for hours. The fun of just grabbing a character, finding a weapon and mowing down zombies is incomparable. I'm not sure I can afford to get the expansions and promos, but time will tell..."
213,bdistracted,N/A,"I enjoyed this game, but it's not exactly what I was hoping for. A co-op game that has individual defeat feels a little harsh to me. What I mean is someone may get caught in a flood of zombies with their last character and they're out until the game is over, which can be a very long time if it's the right scenario.

The rule book is confusing, they have the pictures which help some but in most cases if they covered something in a picture they don't bother to talk about it in the text, which can lead to a frustrating 'where's waldo' feel trying to figure the rules out.

One play through is all it took for most of those I play with to decide they didn't want to play this game anymore."

234,bertinc,7,"FINAL THOUGHTS: I'm lowering my score for this game. Not because I like it less, but because I now have a lot more experience with board games. Technically, I have a lot of issues with this game. The character cards are awful. The variable power concept is poorly designed and probably as a money making ploy. I still enjoy Zombicide, but honestly it feels more like a good tool kit than a well designed game. The setup is terrible. It's hard to remember all of the rules. And I feel like I can only bring this out with people who truly enjoy a long and slightly more complex game.

This game is the reigning champion for my gamer group.  It is always the expected main course to a night of trying lots of different games.  Everything is just leading up to a cooperative romp around the streets of Zombicide.  And I can't blame them.  It is strategic and well balanced.  It has the potential to be easy or very hard.  The scenarios range in super short to kinda long but not too long.  There is purpose and everyone can feel like a useful component to the team.  It is just as much fun with 2 people as it is with 6.  It is all around a great game.

Update 7/8/2013: I'm upping my original score from an 8 to a 9.  Now that I really grasp the rules, this game is tons of fun.  I played a scenario for the second time and I can see how even with only the challenges in the physical manual, this game can be fresh every time.  I want the expansions because I love this game, but honestly I don't think they are needed to have several more years of fun.

Update 4/27/2013: I got to play the first scenario in the manual with 3 friends tonight. We used all of the zombie spawn cards for the full experience. As we got further up in levels we took a few risks and ended up loosing two people, but we managed to win in the end. There are still a few rules I am unclear about. I think overall it was about 95% correct. I'll have to re-read the updated rules and the FAQ a few more times. It was a close game. We were on edge as we started to see more and more zombies enter the map. We feared the runners. There were times that we thought we would lose and there were times that we managed some hilarious zombie slaughtering good fun.  Overall, this game is a hit. Now I want the expansions.

Finally tried the tutorial scenario tonight.  It was actually pretty fun all alone.  The tutorial is meant to be extremely easy but I ended up losing two of my people before reaching the objective.  I made a mistake following the rules and forgot to spawn in zombies when I first walked into a room and didn't realize it until I was almost done moving all of my survivors.  And on top of that one of my searches produced an extra zombie in the room.  So, basically the room two of my people were sitting in had three zombies all of a sudden and there was nothing I could really do about it.  So, I let Ned die, even though he had his free search and a flashlight.  I figured I could still win for sure since Josh was the other survivor in the room and he has the slippery skill.  I lost Amy in that room too on my next turn, but Josh had enough action points to walk into the room with the objective and pick it up.  Josh didn't get attacked because I had Phil shooting from outside to make noise.  Technically I only lost two, but I kept playing for fun to see if Phil could get Josh out of the building.  He did but it cost him his life.  Overall, I can see the immense amount of strategy involved.  If I had that much fun by myself, I can imagine that playing with a bunch of friends would be a blast."

243,bigjay415,7,"I'm not sure if this is an interesting take on cooperative gaming, or bad mechanics. Zombicide's targeting hierarchy is sure to leave some shaking their heads. It definitely forces you to think outside the box as you and your teammates attempt to tackle objectives. Often, grouping survivors together can be disastrous. Which wouldn't be such a bad thing if it weren't so unnatural. Where Zombicide excels is in it's simple rules set and quick gameplay. There's really not much to it, which means you can jump right in and start blasting and hacking away. Spawning mechanics assure plenty of zombies to keep everyone busy. And need I mention the minis are fantastic? Overall, is a great looking game that provides some light, frenzied fun."

282,booned,7,"An interesting perspective I've received, playing Ghostbusters before Zombicide.

Zombicide is the earlier, and definitely better, game. Ghostbusters seems to be going for a more casual ride with shorter sessions, and on the face of it I support that. But the gameplay is somehow unsatisfying, and also uninspired, now that I can compare it to Zombicide and see how they more or less copied it.

Zombicide definitely has a better arc, even if it's quite a bit longer."
283,bop517,10,"This is what I wanted out of a zombie game.  The feel of doom, feeling of dread.  

I'm not a co-op fan but this one was perfect.  

Scenario 1 is very tough but we *really* worked together.  Everyone had ideas and it was one of the best co op experiences I had gaming.  I know part of it was my group, too.  But because of that, I give this an 8 playing with people I know well. 

Well, after a few more plays I bump it to a 9.  Played with the Toxic Mall and with seven.  It was pretty damn awesome.  Best co-op game I have played, by far.

March 2017 - a 10.  Not that it's the perfect game but I enjoy the experience so much when we get a big group to play 6-8 people."

290,BoulevardJoe,7.25,"Great game if only for the company that created it. In my opinion, I think they realized that game nerds are going hack your game no matter what you do/build and so they actually just built it into their game/philosophy.

Their website has a program you can download to create your own tiles to use in scenarios you create. In conjunction, they encourage you to create your characters to use beyond those provided. Also, they've just released an ipad app (!) to use in concert with their standard set-up. Finally, all of this DIY material is further encouraged by the community that they've encouraged where you can submit your own tile designs, scenarios, etc.

All in - Very fun game. I'm personally a little hazy on how the sound mechanism works in-game but a solid game nonetheless. A bit too unwieldy for non-gamers, at least on the first go of it. I'd personally like a campaign-style component wherein equipment/injuries/advancements/etc. are carried from game to game. "

300,Bregeduur,9,"Rating for Zombicide plus all expansions.

Yes, Zombicide as a whole system has its obvious flaws. Yes, some gameplay elements are thematically unsound. No, this does not affect the game in any bad way unless you houserule them (these gameplay elements balance the game; you should not try to change these or you will break the game). Yes, this is ameritrash in its absolute 99.8% purest form. Yes, it's very luck based. Yes, there is indeed only very little strategic value.

Despite all this; play Zombicide on any day with any group of any number of people - new and veteran hobbyists alike - and you WILL have fun.

It doesn't matter if some gameplay elements are flawed. It doesn't matter that some characters are more valuable than others. It doesn't matter if not much happens for a few turns. Nothing matters, because you WILL have a blast. The whole evening. Shooting and killing zombies. Digging through trash to find an awesome weapon. Shouting at other players to decide who should or can do the most damage to the most threatening group of zombies. Trying to run away from an abomination up until someone finally finds that motherf*****g gas canister.

Any day playing Zombicide is filled with fun, laughter and sometimes heroic stories which can stick in your brain for weeks on end.

The only real downside is that there is player elimination involved. Which is always bad in any game that can take a few hours to complete."

It might have been the two scenarios we played (I forget) but it was a bit boring, in the 2nd one we were halfway across the map before anything dangerous appeared.

For a mindless dice-chucking game it has a ridiculously long setup / tear down, the zombie minis are all the same colour, and every scenario plays out exactly the same. And it’s 100% dice rolling luck. Roll poorly and all that hard work to get in a good position was a waste of time. Win, and its not because you played well — it’s the dice."

There is very little to the game apart from running around and killing zombies, but the game play is so fast and smooth, the rules are so easy to teach, and the game is so fun to play that it does perfectly what a light game like this should do: entertain thoroughly without bogging game play down with excessive rules. 

The much maligned ranged weapons rules are stupid, I agree, and were a seemingly lazy solution on the part of the designers to encourage people to engage the zombies in melee combat. I wish some official variant were approved (i.e. misses hit survivors) to satisfy players and provide a realistic justification for the rule, but in the end I still play with the rules as written, and the game works just fine.

Only slightly, though, because while I would be willing to give it another shot or two, the gameplay just wasn’t anything special.
The miniatures were cool, but the game was pretty random because of the big amount of die rolls which have a great impact on how well you’re going to do. I’m not a fan of dice game where the luck cannot be mitigated properly, so this coop wasn’t my cup of tea.

It's each to teach, and all the miniatures are fun to work with, especially showing it to people that have never played these large games before. It's expensive ,but well worth it. It's like playing an episode of The Walking Dead each time. With dozens more missions and characters on various websites you can download and print, this makes the the game that much more valuable. I really enjoy bringing this game out as a party game for strategists. Campaigns played so far have ranged from 1hr to 3.5hrs. Its thrilling working as a group to escape the game's scenarios. For larger games, once you run out of zombie miniatures, I have been using the counters from my card games (chessex 36 mini D6), otherwise the rules state all zombies get one extra move, which I don't think is quite fair since that relies on you just spending more money on extra zombies (expensive) to make sure that doesn't happen. I just assign a dice value for each zombie type and keep on playing. I've not had a bad time playing this game yet, even with a group of 4-5 friends ,all playing for 3 hours, and losing after all that time... it's still a blast to play."

-No pregenenerated Zombies. The game does not have any any Zombies in play when the players take their first turn.

Rules Notes:
-Molotov are not found by searching, they are made by combining Gasoline and Bottle equipment cards."
504,dangahboi,8.5,"My favorite zombie game of all time!
I loved this game from the first play.
And I know it's flawed in some ways, but it's also amazing in so many more! I've got non-gamers into games with this as a gateway game so many times. They rush out and buy the next day.
Easy to teach. Clear and concise board. Video-game like player stats and player powers/level-ups. Fast paced, lots of cooperation and player interaction. Feels like you're in a zombie movie when the swarms of zombies come at you. So rewarding when you win! Lots of scenarios to play. Dice rolling works for me in this game only because zombies are so unpredictable, it feels right to be ""rolling dice"" to land a kill-shot/hit. You just never know if that hit did the zombie in or not.
Perfect game for zombies. And if you're not a zombie fan, you might be after playing this game."
505,DANIEL VAZQUEZ,9.5,Castellano.
506,DanielRichard,7.6,"PROS
I really got the feeling we were fighting horde of zombies, for once! The fact you can really kill any of them with powerful weapons is very satisfying. I also liked the fact we could easily exchange weapons in order to balance players power (no weak player following behind the whole game.) Also, we had some freemdom: ie, we didn't have to stay on the exact same tile all of the game (as it was the case in Dark Darker Darkest).

CONS
On the downside, I don't feel we had that many choices along the way. Also, I'm worried the game might not have a huge replayability.

541,DearGeorgina,4,"The zombies are coming!  The zombies are coming!

I am armed with a pan.  

Yes, when the apocalypse comes, I'll be Martha Stewart.  

And thus begins a series of very frustrating experiences with Zombicide.  With a pan, I have little chance to actually hit anything, but finding weapons is tough.  So I mostly trail around after the rest of my team-mates and try not to die.  The game's owner has an extra tray of zombies, but we still run out quickly, which gives the zombies an a bonus turn and makes things even more precarious for us.  And then there's the rule that if you use a ranged weapon in the same square as another player, you hit them, because we're all just that stupid.

(Look, I've never fired a gun in my life, but I have faith that if I were to do so right now, my friends would STAND BEHIND ME.  I'm not on the grassy knoll, people.  Bullets are not going to curve.)

The game manages to convey a feeling of overwhelming odds better than any other cooperative game I've played. The sheer amount of zombies on the board combined with the fact that one mistake or miscalculation can be fatal makes it a real tightrope walk. Sure, there are some things that are less than perfect, such as the targeting rules and the possibility of an early player elimination - but all together Zombicide is so far the best zombie experience I've had in a board game form.

It's not a particularly deep game, but I'd guess it's the rare Zombie fan that's into the psychological ramifications.  Rather guilt-free head smashing, which this game delivers in spades."
557,Dennis Murray,7,"I'll paraphrase Joel Eddy on this one: 'it's a box of miniatures with some patched together rules and scenarios.'  The scenarios don't seem well playtested with some very easy and others very hard. And the rules have some big gaps of logic as well. All that said, it *is* kind of fun. I'm just not willing to fall down the rabbit hole of buying a ton of stuff for one game."
558,dennyextreme13,9,great game!
559,derenne,5,"Eu diria que ele vale mais como ""experiência"" do que como ""jogo"" propriamente dito, o fator sorte é muito elevado e as escolhas parecem bastante óbvias. A diferença é que, como quase todo jogo cooperativo, faz a mesa pular com uma boa rolagem de dados.
Em comparação com o meu cooperativo favorito, Ghost Stories, Zombicide quase não tem tensão e o elemento ""vamos todos morrer"" não chega perto."
560,Derkanus,10,"This is everything I wanted Zombies!!! to be:  Co-op gameplay, tons of cool weapons, great miniatures, thick cardboard tiles, different layouts and scenarios, unique characters with their own special abilities earned by killing zombies and leveling up, and rules that are actually fun to play with, with tons of different actions you can take (and no rolling for movement!).

There could stand to be a bit more variety in the tiles, but I'm sure future expansions will address that."
561,Dertywerk,10,"This is currently my favorite board game that I own. The art is great, the masses of zombies amazing, the modular board fantastic. The greatest thing about this game to me is that it manages to make you feel overwhelmed. This is exactly how a zombie game should make you feel. Also this game is amazingly difficult but sill fun. I have had more fun loosing this game than winning most others."
562,DesembarcodelJedi,N/A,Ximo
563,Destrio,6,"Rules are moderately complex and the designers went for a simpler ruleset rather than complex rules to fit the theme. I don't mind the friendly fire rule, but don't like the added complexity of the actions dealing with vehicles. Scenario progression is nonlinear, which can be a good thing but I prefer a cohesive story. It is a lot of fun to throw a lot of dice and destroy a lot of zombies but the deep tactical play is not present.

Pros: Lots of decent quality miniatures. Huge scenario list, character list, and sandbox style design allows for custom scenario building. Kickstarter material not even missed. Simple to teach and play system. Different types of zombies introduce some variation in gameplay. Can play a wide number of players.

Cons: Some time needed to setup game, especially with more expansion material. Straightforward strategy and very little tactics. Fiddly rules with the later expansions. Scenarios run long."

601,domus_ludorum,8.5,"I was looking for a Zombie game based on the classic zombie scenario -

- Zombies was a bit too simplistic and the pvp didn't quite feel right.

- 'Last Night on Earth' seemed a bit straight-jacketed by it's scenarios, was handicapped by needing one player to play the zombies and I wasn't big on the art.

- 'Carnival Zombie' is good but it isn't the 'classic' zombie scenario/sandbox.

- Zpocalypse hasn't had great reviews

- Dawn of the Zeds (Second edition), sounds good but I believe it's based on the 'States of Seige' engine which is OK but a bit limited - wouldn't mind having a look at it though.

- I have 'Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game' on the way but although it looks promising there isn't a whole lot of 'zombie' in it, I don't think. UPDATE - I was wrong there is quite a lot of 'zombie' in DoW but it is a slightly different take on the genre, so there is room for both.

So I went for Zombicide - 

Having now played Zombicide I'm definitely pleased with the purchase as it's a great zombie sandbox covering the all action part of the genre. The rules work fine out of the box but can easily be refined for your group's taste.

I'm not a big fan of the zombie amoeba splitting rule or the ranged targeting priority or the extra activation cards - all of which make the game (based on scenario 01 at least) silly hard. But the basic framework is flexible enough to easily accommodate house rules. I will be playing a few more times with the rules as written and then modifying to suit.

Great production values  - pretty sure this is the zombie game I was wanting.  "
602,DONOSAURU5REX,9,"Excellent game.  The miniatures are amazing and the gameplay is smooth and fun.  The original rules are almost perfect, though they are very adaptable to play.  There are 10 scenarios in the rule book, but thousands more online.  Replayability is IMMENSE!"

618,drasher25,6,"I think game succeeds brilliantly at what it sets out to do.  It is a fantastic production and has a nice clean ruleset.  It also avoids the trap of sticking one player with controlling the zombies like in Last Night on Earth.

A lot of people seem to complain about the targeting priority rules, but I actually think that is the most interesting part of the game.  You can't just run in your brawlers and stand back with your shooters.  Figuring out how to deal with that is the most tactically challenging aspect of the game.  

Ultimately, though, the game boils down to running up to zombies and rolling dice at them., which is too simplistic to hold my interest for long.  The expansions add some nice new features, but not really much depth.  This just isn't for me at this point in my gaming life.

657,eateng300,7.75,"Zombicide is a customizable cooperative game set in a zombie apocalypse.  Players are survivors that are trying to find equipment, rescue other survivors, or making it to a shelter while avoiding the clutches of the mindless brain-hungry horde.  There are several preset scenarios that come with the game, or you can download a myriad of fan-made scenarios, or even make your own.  

Players make their way through a tile based city map to complete objectives and search for better equipment to deal with the zombie threat.  As players get more experience from killing zombies, the zombie spawns become increasingly difficult.  The action simulates a video game style as players upgrade their crowbars, pans, and pistols to rifles, shotguns, and chainsaws while the zombie body count rises.

In my experience Zombicide seems to plays best with 3 players controlling 2 survivors each because there is player elimination.  With 6 players, if your character dies there is little else for you to do.  Plus with fewer players it is easier to coordinate tactics than with a large group.  

Does Zombicide have the most elegant rules or tight gameplay?  No.  Are the dice-based combat and card-drawn zombie spawns highly luck based? Yes.  But despite that, my group and I have had a ton of fun taking on the horde and scrambling for our lives!  The game is highly customizable so you can easily make house rules, and come up with your own scenarios or campaigns.  Obviously this type of game isn't for everyone, but it's pretty clear what you're getting into just from the title itself.  If a zombie-themed, dice-rolling, tactical game of slaughter and survival sounds appealing, I'd recommend you give this one a look.    "

Normalmente jogo com mesa cheia, mas jogar com menos de seis jogadores (ou menos do que a missão pede) também é legal porque vc controla mais de um personagem, sendo que é você quem vai escolher a ordem dos seus personagens na sua vez de jogar, e isso trás uma gama estratégica diferente e bastante interessante.

UPDATE: One of the reasons I dropped Wizard Kings was because lack of scenarios to play. The Zombicide people know how to support their game after the fact.

Holy cow I love this game. Co-operative zombie slaying. Different characters, modular boards, and a plethora of missions make this one really replayable. I also like the mechanism that lets the zombies ramp up as you gain experience and skills -- it forces you to share the kills with the rest of the group.

I also have to give major kudos to the company for continued support: extra missions and characters are freely downloadable from their website as well as templates you make our own characters.

697,ePICFAeYL,10,"Zombicide is my 2nd favorite game. Biggest complaint I hear about the game is how ranged combat works, and it's VERY easy to house rule that so it is not a problem.

Any variant of Zombicide is fun, but this is my personal favorite given the modern theme. I got into it really heavily when I was into Walking Dead so that may have swayed me away from Black Plague. Can't go wrong with any Zombicide though!"
698,epicgamer,7,"Need to understand the rules better as I am not sure if we missed something in my first couple games. The challenge and tactical decisions could add up to make a very good game, but I need to try it again before I can tell for sure."
699,epilgrim,6,"Very amusing and truly a cooperative game, you need to go over the rules carefully and accept that it seems easy at the beginning because you missed something important. The various characters all have something they are ""best"" at, you need to use that skill constantly.

If you're a killing machine, survival is a secondary consideration.

The miniatures are much less impressive than they appeared on the kickstarter campaign, but I'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge they are above and beyond what most game pawns look like.

This may be the penultimate zombie game, but I'll happily play your copy.

Mall of Horror is better in my opinion, because the behavior and stress it elicits is less fun and more human.

Regardless, I cannot deny the appeal of wielding a chainsaw, wading into a zone full of the undead and giving them last rites."
700,eracer68,8,"When I rate a game, its generally based on my enjoyment and perceived value. For me, Zombicide has been a huge win. A simple rule set, compelling decisions, and a great theme has kept it on the table for 10 straight plays in a row. I typically buy a game, play it once, maybe twice, and shelf it (sometimes permanently). This is one of the few games that has commanded repeat performances. There is a large number of additional missions available on the official Zombicide site. That, and the expansions which introduce new zeds (and thus require new strategies) should help keep this game fresh for a while. I passed over this one numerous times in the past due to the cost and unattainable exclusive Kickstarter content. Now, I'm sorry I did. 

11/23/2018 While I really enjoyed it when I first got it, getting it back to the table after a couple of years did not elicit the same response. Still fun, but scaling issues and the sheer explosion of zeds keep it from being a better game. 

I'd recommend using the ranged weapon house rule where any miss into another zone with a survivor hits a survivor and misses in the same zone only hit a survivor if a one was rolled. Then to help with scaling, for every two fewer survivors deployed, I removed one zed from each spawn card (to a minimum of at least one spawned if a spawn is generated)."

What I like about this the most is the ""OMG, WE ARE DONE"" feeling you can't get rid of while playing.

this game should be hard and you should loose a lot.
rules have many flaws, but we find it funniest when we make bad stuff happen to us when we are not sure what should happen.

At the end, it doesn't matter if you win (or most likely loose).

If you are looking for a thematic game in which the only thing that matters is killing zombies and having fun from it, GET THIS GAME!

750,fizzle,3,"A most basic cooperative game of Zombie hunting (or rather being hunted by Zombies; no, slowly being overwhelmed by ever-growing Zombie hordes). I like that they managed to keep the rules simple and intuitive for once, but unfortunately they are now so simple that there is nothing left to do for the players. The crucial decision points all hinge on either random dice rolls or random card draws, and the players can use their (hopefully) superior probability calculation skills to increase their odds in those endeavors.

""Why would you want to open that door? That will add approximately 15 more zombies to the board, and if we just stick to the road, we'll be out of the city in about 5 turns."" ""But, but... if we don't go into the house we won't be able to find stuff!""

In the words of one of those players who actually seem to like the game the problem with the short scenarios is that they are ""just not interesting."" The problem with the longer scenarios, of course, is that they are long. Very long. With not an interesting decision in sight. Oh please, dear zombies, just kill me now."

I think it helps the games depth and strategy. The one rule I don't like is that extra turn if you run out of zombies to add. I would be fine with it if the scenarios stated you can only have X models of each type but the fact someone who has extra zombies over the 64 in the base might not encounter that rule means I don't feel bad house ruling that out. I'll just use glass beads as additional models if needed.

Instead, buy this game because it feels like a zombie game should feel: Hectic, fast, and dangerous. 

Having to perform bookkeeping (which plagues many thematic games and washes them of their flavor) during a zombie apocalypse would be truly asinine. Fortunately Zombicide--with its simple rules, clever kill trackers, and waves of undead--feels like a zombie apocalypse. Better yet, the different missions with deep and changing strategy makes for a fun board game.

797,G4M3rZ_TWITCH,8,such a great guilty pleasure.  this is a wonderful game to play with people who want something lighter that feels heavier and with the bonus of being able to see just how boned you are being physically surrounded by miniatures.  only to turn around and mow them all down with chainsaws and uzis.

We play with a house rule, where each player can make his actions simultaneously with other players, so the cooperation aspect of the game is reinforced.

Also we use a rule to force rooms to get empty after a player draws a food or Argh card. This forces the players to explore."
799,Gaius,8.5,"Cooperative horror slugfest.  IMO, if you want a no-hassle zombie game buy this one.  Reminds me somewhat of Descent at a tactical level, but a much simpler execution.  Also very satisfying to see the hordes of detailed zombie miniatures swarming the modular map.  A fairly well thought out game with brilliant simplicity, although the balance can be bit swingy with the zombie card draws (but the zombie deck can be tailored).  Equipment cards and zombie types are great, made better with the variety of the expansions.  Currently enjoying an extended campaign with a few variants for more of an RPG feel.  To date, beyond the big box expansions (Toxic City Mall, Prison Outbreak, Rue Morgue and Angry Neighbors) I own the following small expansions: Set #2 (Survivors & Zombivors), Set #3 (Survivors & Zombivors), Set #5 (Zombie Dogz), Set #6 (Dog Companions), Set #7 (Lost Zombivors), and also Compendiums #1 and #2 and Experience Deck."

Since I've bumped into the first Kickstarter for Zombicide last year by accident, my friends and I have played it more than 20 times. Thus It quickly replaced all other boardgames I used to have.

The games simplicity yet strategy based rules will have players returning to the game again and again. Even people I know who dislike zombies, and boardgames have still joined in on the frenzy zombie madness and kept coming back for more.

The fact that the GG have shown so much loyalty to their fans and still keeps feeding us with new missions, will assure that we never have had to play the same mission twice.

Great action packed Zombie Game. All of the shooting, carnage and cheese that Last Night on Earth overlooked. 

Pros:
Blast your way through hordes of Zombies. Game ramps up quickly with crazy Zombie respawn. New skills when leveling along the danger track acts to compensate and bring more destruction to the game.
So many brilliant miniatures, bring your own paint job to customise. Chainsaw and a shot gun. - Achievement unlocked Ash Factor! Driving cars over zombies.
Sandbox game so you are limited only by your imagination once you have played through the scenarios. Holds up well to Solo play.

Cons:
Very easy to die, some players may be sitting out for a while. Lengthy game play. High luck factor in combat.

It wasn't actually much fun being armed with a pan for most of the game, finding bags of rice when searching for weapons, and after finally getting a pair of guns, having the opportunity to kill exactly one zombie before the game ended.

915,hans4rd,9,"Not without a few flaws but overall, amazing fun. Enough tactics with tense moments and lots of dice and luck thrown in. Simple yet superbly engaging. Now with unbelievable amounts of content to add or leave out, at your whim and want. Maybe a minor tweak for balance next time is all you will need for creating wild changes to the system. Very cool.

This is maybe the most cinematic game i own, and it rewards you with a crazy roller coaster tale every time. Even when playing solo, it never misses a beat. This, and more, helps make the game a top 5 title hands down. 
It has to lose some marks for that age old problem, i.e: for scenario, read: Puzzle. ala space hulk etc. 
But unlike many games with this type of map making, Z'cide is so immersive, win or lose. You often get swept along in the fun and panic, so much so in fact, that you forgot you could have maybe puzzle solved your way out of it.

Bought Toxic City Mall after a little, ""what should i buy next"" research.
After which, I got on the final KS for the experience.
My season 3 KS arrived. This was the biggest pile of 'stuff' I have ever seen.
I didn't know what to do with the plastic mountain for the longest time, I either had to embrace what I had, or sell the lot.
After a couple of games with my 9 yr old lad, who absolutely loved it (his 2nd favorite behind Talisman, I'm told), I've decided to embrace it.

I have spent a good few quid on Z'cide, but I never feel the need to own every last little thing. Luckily i left that illogical completionist nonsense far behind me many moons ago. I will possibly buy one or two after market minis, but i will have to really want them, i am in no hurry, and it will have to be at a very  sensible price. So probably never. The retail shelf stuff gives you more than a lifetimes worth for 1 game out of, no doubt many games on your shelf anyhoo.
So far I have bought aftermarket: Bill from ebay in america for less than 8 quid inc postage. Swerengen is a favorite tv character of mine, so i had him on ebay alert, it was cheaper to get him sent across the pond than pay any UK hawkers price. 
Plus, I got the puke green dice for a tenner, as a bit of fun for my son. 
Both overpriced, in my book, but it's not going too mad. Not a lot else interests me enough to pay over the odds for really. You can usually find a mini amongst all the retail kit, that resembles the pose of who you want to proxy easily enough. Only a huge lottery win could tempt me to want any 1st ed exclusives etc on the open market.

I have just sold a pile of games so had a little dabble into 2nd hand prison outbreak territory. 
Seems many prefer the equipment deck, there are some neat survivors, berserkers are popular, and I would definitely like to play as Grindlock!

Well, now we are pretty organised. We know what we have, and pretty much, what we like to mix in.
So me and my lad will be having a blast with the system. Even if he doesn't get the sub MG's & Chainsaw every game.....so he says! 
""You have the pan dad"". 

Good times.
"
916,Hantis,7,Good concept but after a few plays it feels samey. Theme is not my favorite either but the real problem is replayability.
917,happyjosiah,7,"Zombicide is a tactical minis game about survivors killing zombies. It has a modular board, various scenarios, and heroes with different special abilities. Heroes can spend their turn searching for items in buildings (but not outside) and will be forced to fight any Zombies in their space. So far, everything I've said could also be said of Last Night on Earth. It seems a virtual certainty that Zombicide took a lot of influence from this earlier game. 

So what are the differences? Well, the main one is that Zombicide is a pure co-op, where the zombies are automatically controlled by certain rules. Another is that the more experience the heroes have, the tougher the zombie outbreaks become. Lastly, noise is a factor; firing a gun may attract more Zombies (and noise can even be used in your favor). 

One of the complaints some people have about Last Night on Earth is that the zombie player doesn't have as many interesting decisions as the hero players do. This is true from the perspective of tactical positioning, but the zombie player also has many more cards in hand to work with, so I personally think they are just ""different"", not less interesting. I also strongly prefer competitive games to co-operative ones. In light of that, this game, while a lot of fun, seems very redundant to me. 

Last Night on Earth has shown that it is primarily a ""toolkit"" kind of game. It would be very possible to make a purely co-operative scenario by cranking up the difficulty of the zombies. It would also be possible to have scenario rules for noise. Consequently, this game feels to me like playing someone's homemade scenario for Last Night on Earth, rather than a game unto itself. Since I love Last Night on Earth, this isn't necessarily a drawback, but I can't help feeling that this game is much more limited in its capabilities to come up with interesting scenarios. I just can't see a lot of reason to play this over Last Night on Earth, though it is a lot of fun."

922,harry cherry 1972,10,great family game
923,Hatepig,7,Better than Last Night on Earth though Zombicide needs some house rules to make this game great.
924,HavocIsHere,8,"It's over expensive, I don't like the heroes sculpts that much; some people are exhilarated by them, but I do prefer the heroes of LNOE; the zombies sculps are better and more varied, but yet do not justify the price tag; there are much much better zombies minis available.
The tiles are double faced but all buildings amount to the same; they lack variety.

But, unlike LNOE, everybody plays survivors and the game plays much faster; it lacks the variety introduced by the cards in LNOE, but the system is much more fluid. 
It feels more tactical, and also the story told, even if it lacks the story elements and dark humor introduced by the decks of LNOE, feels more true to the zombie genre and more verisimilar.

The game takes significantly longer than expected, but the action isgripping enough so it does not feel long to me.

In summary it's an overpriced good zombie game caracterized by a clean and streamlined design, and largely succeeds in recreating the mood and atmosphere of zombie flicks."

People have been putting down the ""you alway hit the survivor first"" mechanic for ranged combat, but we all thought it added some tension and excitement to the game.

The board and minis are top-notch, and the box has great storage for them all.

This is a coop game, but it's not like your usual coops. If one person dies, the game is not over.

It is so fun watching the horde of zombie's grow! The miniature quality of this game is excellent. Player boards and artwork are superb. It does have a few rules that don't make sense that you might want to house rule. For example, when firing a gun into a zone with zombie's and your friends....it says you automatically hit your friends first. You might want to change that because this game is HARD as it is!

One of the reasons this was such a hit was because of how you learn the game. Rather than sitting down and having someone bombard you with all the rules and nuances of the game; this rulebook has a tutorial mission where you learn all the different mechanics and how all the basics work. It only takes about 20 minutes or so to go through it.

Unfortunately the game has some balance issues... like several scenarios that are far too easy or far too difficult (impossible?) as written, and various overpowered strategies (e.g. car exploitation, pass the chainsaw, etc).  It feels like some brief playtesting would have caught many of these issues... like the designers had tested 3 or 4 scenarios, then made up 6 or 7 more (without testing them) to fill up the rule book.

It does, however, have player elimination without the guarantee of a quick finish after the first elimination.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2013)

I love zombie games so I was keen on trying Zombicide. My first play was hugely disappointing, but that was due to a big mistake on the rules (zombies never appeared in buildings) made by the explainer. My second game was much more enjoyable. 

The game components are superb, the zombie minis are great and the scenarios are very fun to play. I also like that the game is pretty hard to win, until now, no one in my game group has been able to successfully finish a mission (without rules mistakes).  The game is very fluid so it generally plays relatively quickly (perhaps because we died so often). More important, the downtime is very short. 

On the bad side the game is pretty expensive, I’m not sure if I want to spend that kind of money on this game (although I probably will). The player boards seemed like a good idea at the beginning, but managing the player`s inventory in the board is a minor pain in the ass. A friend made some better boards and we are using them instead. Also there is a hero mini (Phil) that constantly is mistaken by a zombie and in one game a player attacked it :Devil: It needs to be painted ASAP.

Bottom line a good zombie game. I will upgrade its rating to a 6.5. This is not a game I want to play all the time but it is a game I enjoy. I still prefer to play LNOE because a player can control the zombies, but Zombicide is a lot more tactical than LNOE and that is important to me.
 
Current rating: 6.5

I almost never want to play Zombicide and, in general, I like Zombie games :S. 

After a couple of plays, the game is very boring for me. Lots of luck and obvious decisions, not a Co Op I like. Also with all the add-ons (expansions, promos, etc.) Zombicide is Uber expensive, what a money pit, with this kind of money I could buy several (better) games. I’m glad I didn’t buy it.

The redeeming factor are the gorgeous miniatures, but still that is not enough for me to play the game. 

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my new feelings for the game. If the Zombie mood strikes, I would play Last Night on Earth instead.

Current Rating: 5.0

My desire to play the game is very low. I find it obvious and tedious so I’m downgrading its rating (again) to one that matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system. I will do my best to never play the game again.

1116,joelpetersen,8,"Got this in a trade. Was really reluctant, wanted not to like it for some reason, but I have to break down and confess that it actually really works very well as a zombie experience. Need to paint the zombies though, when there are a lot on the board, its easy to miss a runner. Great components, crappy rulebook. Don't see why you would want the kickstarter extra zombies. The game flows perfectly without them, I would suspect less tension with more figures? EDIT:Oh and just want to add that some of the rules (like having to gun down your teammates before zombies while firing ranged weapons) make little sense thematicly, they add some tension and strategy to the gameplay that would otherwise be missing. Also, why would you ever want the melee weapons if they didn't have anything special going for them? /END EDIT
"

1118,joewyka,8,Definitely a welcome new franchise. The first zombie game I've played that didn't feel like a tedious slog. The rules are at just the right depth to provide interesting group strategizing and yet not slow the game play down. This is a hard game to win!

The production values are good; not great.  They work and they work because of scale and quantity.  I do like the tiles and the amount of detail added, as well.

  Everything has been worked out mechanically to be simple and smooth, even though there are some things that don't exactly makes sense (e.g. splitting zombies, targeting priority), but I can see why they are done this way, and it is for the greater good of the game and ultimately serves the tension the game seeks to produce.   

This is as close to a true zombie apocalypse game as there can be, I think, giving a very cooperative feel that players must work together and protect each other from making poor choices that may lead to bad consequences for everyone(e.g., the leveling up system or opening certain doors).  Therefore, its coop, but with this palpable sense of dread the whole way through.  

Again, this is great stuff.  I'll never need to own another zombie game (other than City of Horror, which is less about zombies and more about negotiation).

High Ameritrash at its self-confidently Ameritrashiest. The tone is on the light-hearted and silly side. It's all very enjoyable.

It seems to me that total player damage output is defined primarily by items and player count. Enemy output is determined by the XP zone of the highest-XP player, which is likely to be lower when there are more players—the kills are spread evenly in expectation among more players, given reasonable assumptions, I guess.

This means that playing at 'wrong' character for your scenario counts can lead to missions that are too easy or too hard."

I really can't think of any redeeming qualities for this game. Somebody always gets screwed with a bad character. Somebody always gets screwed with crappy weapons. Somebody always gets screwed with never being able to kill any zombies to level up their character. Fiddlieness and upkeep are awful. You have to place noise tokens every time a gun is fired or a door opened. Then you have to spawn zombies and figure out what types go where. Then you have to move all the zombies on the board according to their type. And any time you open a door to a building you have to spawn zombies AGAIN in every room of the building. And if that isn't enough, someone is going to be quarterbacking the whole game. It's really just rolling dice for 3 hours listening to someone else tell the team what they should do. 

I could probably be talked into trying the new Zombicide Black Plague but I'm not holding my breath to play it. For now if you are looking for a zombie game with dice rolling then I would recommend Run, Fight, or Die!"
1168,jvbren,6,"Cooperatively, you move, scrounge for new weapons, and fight; the zombies move and spawn. You move, scrounge, and fight; they move and spawn. You slay (thanks new weapons!) again and gain experience; they spawn again in greater numbers. And so on and so on until you have either achieved your team objective or you all die an inglorious death. It gets pretty samey real fast, but if endlessly fighting the undead is your thing, you may enjoy this."

Overall I found it lacking any excitement, decisions were little dull (eg. should I kill this or that group of zombies). I also do not like some rules like shooting always first into your teammates. Of course it could be house-ruled, but still I found it really bad implementation of rule. "

I have heard the rulebook is not great but I learned from another player and found the gameplay to be very easy to understand.  Turns are quick and simple to complete yet there are important decisions to be made.  There seems to be just enough luck to keep it difficult and just enough weapon upgrades to keep players in control.  I prefer playing multiple characters with fewer players and less downtime but I would not pass on a chance to play this game again even with a high player count."

The story the game give rise to, the near shaves, the sacrifice, the early abomination spawn, and the epic ending when the board is swarmed with zombies while you just want to run... Good times

The only issue is the game can seem a little long or at least when we played it last it seemed longer that I wanted it to be, but we were playing with 6 players.

1246,kuiszi_maisza,7,"Nice game, quite easy - you need to kill them all before They will :D not much complicated, but amusing. one minus- I'm not a big fan of the scenario without any time frame - you just have to explore and explore and explore again and again to find e.g. all food from the deck of cards etc - boring one..."

1252,kyrogh,8,"Zombicide est un jeu qu'on adore. La montée en puissance de la difficulté, le stress et la tension qui montent crescendo, le plateau qui se remplit de plus en plus de zombies, la mécanique de gestion automatique des zombies qui est bien pensée (les zombies réagissent aux bruits, à la vision, etc).
Nous avons modifié quelques règles, notamment le fait de tirer en priorité avec une arme à distance sur nos co-équipiers lorsqu'ils se trouvent sur la même case qu'un zombie : maintenant on ne touche nos co-équipiers que sur un jet de 1 aux dés.

Les plus :
- jeu en ""kit"" avec une grosse communauté de joueurs qui créent des scénarios additionnels
- les tuiles et les figurines sont belles et détaillées
- le thème immersif, avec une grosse montée de la pression en fin de scénario !!

Les moins :
- mise en place fastidieuse
- fiches personnages pas pratiques (jeton d'expérience qui tombe, gestion de l'inventaire jusqu'à 5 cartes)
- temps de partie : parfois 2h30 de jeu pour une première partie !"
1253,kytah,N/A,"Zombicide is a collaborative game in which players take the role of a survivor – each with unique abilities – and harness both their skills and the power of teamwork against the hordes of unthinking undead! Zombies are predictable, stupid but deadly, controlled by simple rules and a deck of cards. Unfortunately for you, there are a LOT more zombies than you have bullets.

Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get; the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is zombicide!

Play ten scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, download new scenarios from the designer's website, or create your own!

I backed it through its highly successful kickstarter campaign and the company did a great job at fulfilling all of their promises, even to those in the UK. Ironically the other games I've bought since have relegated this one for one main reason:. The whole thing feels mechanical with usually one obviously optimal way to play through a round. This gives you the sensation that your playing on rails and the choice of everyone in the team is a mirage. I also find the zombie shuffle (the restock and move) a bit tedious but you can't have a zombie horde without a zombie horde. UURRGH!!"

Very easy to pick up, awesome co-op experience, tons of variability with the modular board, fantastic components, simple mechanics. It's not the most strategic game, and random chance plays a large role (lots of dice rolls) but it's always a blast.

1335,LuciferPrime,9,"I love this game. I prefer a modern setting for Zombie games and Zombicide really set the bar high. The game isn't perfect but, IMO, can be house ruled to perfection. You can easily take many of the changes that they made to the formula in Black Plague and apply them easily. My ONLY complaint is the tiles are kind of bendy. I live in a pretty dry area and still see some warping sometimes. They bend back into place easily enough but sometimes start to re-bend while playing which can be annoying. I suggest getting the Walking Dead All Out War Scenery Expansion from Mantic Games to add to Zombicide and the only CMON expansion I think is really worth it is the Zombie Dogs. They increase the difficulty a bit and really add pressure to the game at unexpected moments."

Zombicide has great qualities for a zombie game, but is also overrated. The minis are great, but the game tiles are pretty bad. The colors are weak, and the material is cheap. Thick but can easily be damaged. The tokens also are pretty bland. The game itself can be really fun, but doesn't scale well for less than 5 players. Kept around 90 minutes, it's a nice experience. Anything above is painfully repetitive. The gameplay is simple for a quick dice rolling based fignthing game, there are lots of missions, and I highly praise Guillotine Games for supporting the game with tons of online content.

1402,Martin Ralya,3,"This is a mediocre-though-sometimes-fun game that could be so much more enjoyable if you got to make more interesting decisions and if had benefited from more development time. A few thrilling moments can't make up for the rest of the moments.

The rulebook is sloppy and includes some poor decisions, and the scenarios are apparently in reverse or mixed-up order: #1 is easily one of the hardest, and #10 is a cakewalk. They skimped on the boards (reproducing the same or very nearly the same graphics multiple times feels cheap in a game with such cool minis and this kind of price tag), the character cards are too flimsy to handle sliding the kill marker without moving around all the item cards on them, and the zombie cards make it hard to tell zombies apart. The minis are the big draw, but it feels rushed to print in so many other ways. 

Having spent my first game failing most rolls and not doing much of anything for three hours, I see the potential for that happening again in subsequent games. If one person gets a couple of lucky draws, their ability to rack up kills and level up increases dramatically, while the schlubs get to schlub along. Fuck that noise.

Despite my first game taking three fucking hours, not being much fun, and ending in failure because the first scenario is insane and painful with four players/four characters, I played it a second time. We applied the tweak of having a minimum of six characters (or six lives spread among however many you have), and it made a big difference.

There's a fun game hiding under all the sloppiness and boredom, but it's too well-hidden for me to ever want to see this again. I love zombies and I wanted to like this, but I don't."

The quality of the game pieces, especially the minis, is very high.  I think the replayability is also very high if you factor in the customization in scenarios and the board that are available.  You can really make it your own game.

Highly recommend to everyone who is a pulp zombie movie fan and loves an excellently executed co-op game.

Nice thing to have. If you're ok with Amert games, are ok with modern interpretations of Zombies and want a cooperative then this is it; if you prefer traditional (proper zombies or at least proper zombie films) and want pvp then LNOE is the one (both good games).

Not wild about games getting more expensive but in this case it's fair enough - lots of high quality bits, although I would strongly prefer larger cards.

Mechanicly, despite my criticisms of the lack of them during much of the original KS, the rule set is good and delivers arcade fun, somehow more so than LNOE IMHO. The much maligned 'hit allies if shooting into squares with them' rule while perhaps irritating does add a significant amount of strategic and tactical scope to the game so no complaints here (simply a great rule :thumbsup:). Another common complaint is that the game is overly susceptible to one player calling all of the shot - frankly this is an external problem just don't play with that player.

Decision wise it is what it is. If you want a Zombie game here's a worthy one, if you want a game with deep decision making then look further. Nice game that gives you a dungeon crawler-esq gameplay with some added unique mechanics and the feel of 29 days later survival experience. 

I've added in another box of Zombies (set #1) and Toxic City Mall and think I'm now finished buying stuff from this series, I may be wrong, but will definitely continue to enjoy playing it for years to come.

My group has modified the vanilla game into an entirely different animal, but the game itself begs to be tuned to each individual group's liking. This is not to say I don't think the rules as presented are playable (Myth, anyone?), just a bit clunky.

There are a ton of available additives and preservatives for Zombicide (I've got most), but I admit I'm still waiting for an expansion that adds something genuinely new to the experience rather than adding so much more of the same.

By the end of the game I'm always thinking how we could have played two games of something else that would have been just as fun and challenging.  Secondly, every game seems to be the same.  Sure there's tons of variety in the characters, the items, the many different scenarios and objectives, (and throw in the new seasons and expansions the many new kinds of zombies and environments), but still, every game plays out in the same manner.  I've grown a little tired of it."
1521,MS121HAZEL,9,"Favourite zombie game, great co-op. My favourite game to play on a weekend evening with friends for a strong narrative/imaginative experience.

1522,MScrivner,7,"An incredibly cinematic and narrative driven design. The mechanics are tighter and better tuned and player choices are more strategically meaningful, at least relative to Last Night On Earth or Zombies! I especially liked the scaling effect where the longer the game went on, and the stronger the players got, the tougher the zombies were and the more of them spawned - it created a narrative crescendo that really added to the game play."

1541,muxed,7,"A (not very original) zombie game, hard at the first plays and very coop. Nice game"
1542,muzfish4,9.7,"I was a Kickstarter backer for this one, but to 'sell' it to Mrs Fish I presented it as a Xmas present for myself - ""Look dear, no shopping and no more to pay. All we have to do is wrap it and I'm sorted for Saturnalia"". I got away with it too!

We have managed six plays so far and are really enjoying it. I like the theme and the components are top notch. The miniatures are really well sculpted, both characters and zombies. The modular mapboards are suitably atmospheric and the counters, character boards and suchlike are durable and thoroughly fit-for-purpose. The extra dice that came with the Kickstarter sets are also rather fun. The only negative is that the cards are a bit small and fiddly, but that’s something I can live with.

 I am a big Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game fan as well, but when it's just the two of us it rarely hits the table. As Mrs Fish enjoys co-operative games, she likes a game or three of Pandemic, she was willing to try this one and has even (once) asked to play it over our other 'staples' of Agricola and Race for the Galaxy.

So, having established that the production values are very good and the theme is to my liking and, possibly more importantly, the game will get played in the House of Fish the next question should be about gameplay. I quite like the way it plays, it's reasonably simple to pick up and the game system is very good as a co-operative. That there are four different types of zombies is also good both for the sheer joy of variety as well as the different challenges each sort poses. The most common are ‘walkers’ familiar from the George A Romero films, they shamble on mindlessly, but what they lack in ability they make up for in numbers and can swamp the heroes if given the chance. Then there are ‘runners’ they move twice as quickly and can ruin the best laid plans as they divert the player’s attention away from that they should be doing to dealing with these sprinters. The ‘fatties’ present their own challenges in that not every weapon can kill them, and the abomination is just plain old bad news as it is invulnerable to everything except molatovs – and no-one starts the game with one of those. 

There are a few 'gamey' bits that I don't particularly like, but understand such as trying to explore houses and suchlike while the characters are all still rookies as this level generates fewer zombies (usually - the game we played last night saw an abomination - the toughest of the zombie types – turn up while we were all still on the stating level of experience) but in most non-adversarial game there are always ways to ‘game’ the system.

Other things can be a bit silly such as being able to search a car while in another car. Most of this can be ignored or worked around. Where it excels in design is the use of noise tokens. This adds a tactical element to the game which I really enjoy in that the players can attempt to use the noise they generate doing things like shooting, smashing open doors or even just breathing to manipulate the movement of the zombies and get them away from the areas the heroes need to go to in order to complete their mission.

This is not to say that zombie movement is totally predictable, it can always go a bit wrong, especially when another activation cards is drawn – especially for the runners who move double the rate of everything else. So, plenty of tactical decisions to make as well as an element of unpredictability which can make for some tense and exciting gameplay.

Another plus is that Guillotine Games provide some excellent on-line support for this game with over a dozen new scenarios available on their website was well as version 1.0 of FAQs.

Guillotine Games have also announced that the first expansion will be published when the second batch of Kickstarter stuff (mainly extra characters) ships out around March/April this year.

Looking forward to both!"

1564,Narlgoth,6,"I can kind of see what all the hype is about with this one but I don't personally rate it as high as the lovers do. Its ok but there's plenty of other games I'd play instead given the chance.

What is good? The production qualities are high, the miniatures are beautiful and the tiles (whilst a bit lazily repetitive with No.4's wheelie bin on every road) are big and nice looking. In fact the minis and tiles are SO good I am tempted to get a copy of the game just to tear up the rulebook and use the components for the tactical miniatures game 'All Things Zombie' which is a great system but doesn't have any of its own minis/terrain.

The bad is that the game itself just feels a bit dry and just doesn't pull me in at all. Its very gamey, with odd rules that take you right out of the thematic feeling for the sake of playing straight. Not being able to shoot into other players spaces or drive through them without hitting the players first is silly and could have been implemented better. I also cringe every time 'zombie mitosis' occurs to a zombie with two equal routes to travel. Also there is too many Zombies down manholes in this game!

This one can also be gamed like a bitch- you can often spend several turns stood together waiting for Zeds to funnel in behind you so you can move out of the opposite end of the building. Clever, but totally unthematic. If you all stood in a building and made no noise the Zeds would surely just mill about where they lost track of you..

There's also just too many Zombies (and running ones at that). It usually gets to the point where there is so many spawning that you can't move for several turns for simply killing the front of the que before you are eventually overwhelmed.

I remember when Zombie themed stuff was about suspense and dread (like the original Night of the Dead movie and Resident Evil games), and how one zombie could be really dangerous, let alone 2 or 3! Nowadays there is an obsession for Zombie stuff having 1000s of Zombies that can be easily killed. Its not that its bad, just...meh.

While its still a bar above Zombies!!! at the same time the Coop feature sucks a lot of the fun for me. Zombicide punishes you for thinking and acting on your own. All players are forced to carefully plan their every move as a group because dying is incredibly easy and happens fast if you split up. This makes it great for solitaire play, but pretty lame for Coop as most of the time the group is controlling your character and not you.

Production qualities aside, I personally think Last Night on Earth is better as a Zombie game, even with its oddities and over bloating from too many expansions. Zombicide is no less bloated now I mention it! Toxic zombies, berserker zombies, crawling zombies, dogs, crows, the list goes on, but when will it stop?.."

1583,NerwenGreen,6,"*Note: based on one play including the Toxic City Mall.

Not very well balanced in my opinion. If one character kills lots of zombies while another character isn't able to kill any, the level disparity between them gets very high very fast, and then the zombies become too tough for the lower-level character to ever catch up. How are the non-zombie-killing characters supposed to remain useful then, if there's no other ways to level up?

I also prefer either a fast-and-loose dice chucking game (which was what I was expecting) *OR* deep strategizing/analysis paralysis, not both in the same game, because then it just becomes super frustrating when the dice rolls refuse to back up your strategy."

Despite the decisions made for the targeting rules, I found this game to be just as good as Black Plague. Now, I did play this with the first three seasons mixed in, so this is more of a rating for the modern-day Zombicide experience as a whole. Some of the items are a little under-powered, and the rules for cars are a little odd, but otherwise I had a lot of fun with this. Berserker Zombies and the ones that turn into crawlers make things interesting, too. I think the one area where these older Zombicide seasons struggle more with is the tension. Black Plague does a good job of making things tense throughout, while the older Zombicides are pretty tame until people start getting more XP. Not that there's anything wrong with these decisions, but I do think Black Plague, as a whole, works better, mechanically, than the other seasons."

Oh... This is supposed to be about Zombicide, innit! Well, the fact that when I played Zombicide I kept wishing it was LNoE instead is probably a good indication of my opinion. Zombicide is like a maths puzzle that requires non-stop optimization to win.

The co-worker who brought the game didn't even play. He was basically the GM and added lots of great thematic descriptions and ran all the zombie AI so the players didn't have to worry about those rules.

There was a point in the game where one player was hoarding equipment and another player was wanting to kill the hoarder in order to take a weapon he really wanted.

The hoarding player was soon completely abandoned by the group but managed to survive anyways due to his robust arsenal. This was all in good fun and made for some great moments.

1650,Orphebus,5,"I have not played, I just checked the rules and some reviews. 

It seems just another regular zombie game, in this case, with cool art and gorgeous miniatures. Lots of specific rules for specific cases, at times a bit confusing. The strategic component seems pretty obvious.

So, just for the fun of killing cool zombies.

*********************************
After a couple of games:
-> Big con: you have to avoid leveling up!!!
-> The miniatures are cool, but not as cool as the seemed in the promo material.
-> At the end, you end up doing a lot of metagaming as strategy (killing zombies just to avoid depleting them: one you deplete the zombies, they move double and this is most likely to mean deaths for all players).
-> There are some rules, like the double move, that ruin the strategy.

Still, the powers are cool and the game is better balanced than I expected. I would not mind playing from time to time, but I will never be a fan or buy it."
1651,OsbornBrewing,9,"It's really a RPG in a box.  Very easy to learn, although there is a lot to it.  The co-op mechanic works vs the game controlled zombies which are not difficult to move, but the onslaught starts right away, and never seems to end!

As fun to lose as Pandemic, and have to keep playing to beat it.  The downloadable scenarios are an excellent touch and the campaigns that were released are a ton of fun, although have extended to multiple play sessions.  A great zombie theme execution."

1658,P.O.G.G.,5,"This game is ok, but nothing spectacular.  The theme is well implemented but the gameplay isn't very deep.  Basically, you are running around an urban landscape during a zombie outbreak.  You can move, attack or search for new equipment.  Your characters level up over the course of the game, but there is no campaign mode in the base game.

Some features of this game are:
- co-operative, no hidden information and plays solitaire
- fairly simple rules but the rule book is not as clear as it should be
- nice miniatures and other components
- not a lot of different weapons or other loot in the base game
- lots of dice rolling, so understanding odds and accepting luck is necessary
-as long as one player knows the rules, you can get into the action pretty quickly
- each character has some kind of unique skill or ability and as they level up they receive new abilities
- the game doesn't attempt to balance difficulty with the number of players, so it's best to just play with 6 characters no matter how many people are playing

I'm sure a lot could be done with this system to make it more interesting, but the base game itself isn't something I'd care to play very often."

I'd push and promote the game on all my friends,  but after several plays, the game just doesn’t pass as a game to me. It almost feels like it started out as a collectible pack that someone who has only played one or two board games decided to turn into a game. 

Why? 
(1) One item deck for every room. 
(2) Survivor-First Target Priority.
(3) Useless items that can’t be combined into something more useful.

All of those make for an extremely un-thematic experience, (2) being the worst. Of all the ways ranged weapons could have been balanced, that is by far the strangest. 


What might work better?
(1) Different decks for different types of rooms with limited searches. (eg. Garage/Mechanical = +% Gasoline cans)  
(2) Dual-sided Ammo/Noise tokens that would limit the Survivor from just range-ing everything. 
(3) Combining edible items to create Healing items. Cliché, but better than hauling around a bag of rice."

But that was too easy:  In complete opposition to its impressive miniature, a dragon is ridiculously underpowered here. And artillery units are much too powerful! I have never felt really threatened during the entire course of the game. At the end, I was even tempted to go on alone against the handful of monsters left on the board to ""finish them off""! Also, another player acted entirely alone: He opened doors rooms and searched for items, never fearing any monster eventually popping up while crossing obstacles...  

Zombies are mindless monsters, indeed, but the necromancers shouldn't be: They should be able to control their monsters more skilfully instead of acting totally independently! A better ""monster"" AI or a human player for the ""monsters""/enemies, as in Conan, should make this game more challenging, IMHO...

1674,patchwerq,10,"Zombie Hoards! This is the closest thing yet to playing Left 4 Dead in board game format. The components are fantastic, the box storage is excellent and protects the minis well. The board looks awesome. This is quick to learn and easy to remember rules. This game is great for new or casual gamers. We have had some ""not so interested in playing a board game"" people over, and we have hooked them into playing board games completely and solely based on this board game! Sometimes the game can feel too easy, but then I remember that killing zombies should be fun. But on the other hand there are plenty of scenarios that will kick you when you are down...hard and beyond! Spinning around in a circle with a chain saw and taking out ferocious zombies hoarding around you...now that is classic Left 4 Dead stuff! This game can have you whooping and hollering when your character(s) are seemingly surrounded in a no-win situation...and all of a sudden one character decides to pull out the duel sub-machine guns to save the day. Or maybe you find an abandoned car, jump in and mow down an oncoming hoard of walkers. Take that you zombie scum!

Some of the best features of the game are the zombie split. This can be devastating and can catch you with your pants down. When a zombie is equidistant to 2 locations an equal number of zombies must go in both locations (thus adding new zombies, unexpectadly to the board). Another great feature, is the experience meter. As you kill zombies, your experience goes up with each kill. Thus moving you into the more dangerous yellow, orange and deadly red zombie spawning danger zones. 

If there is anything we learned in Left 4 Dead it's...stick together! There is so much interaction...so much table talk...laughter...whooping for joy...morning the loss of a pet dog...discussion...tactical thinking...that this game is such a thrill to play! Anytime we have a game night...this game is mentioned and it is hard to resist playing."

1680,PBrennan,8,"A neat co-op with simple rules which mesh thematically nicely with the simple beasts that keep on coming. Lots of different scenarios, but basically you have 3 actions with which to move, shoot (dice rolling) or get a card which will generally provide ongoing item-type benefits. What makes this a bit different is that the zombies don't fight. They have a search algorithm to come after you, and if your turn ends with a zombie on your space, you're taking a wound. Two wounds and you're kaput. And moving off a space requires an extra action for each zombie on that space. So if you get cornered and fail to shoot your way out of there by rolling well, you could be inundated. Nicely thematic. Meaning the game does actually require you to plan and co-ordinate with your fellows. There's randomness in the spawning, there's randomness in the shooting - manage it as best you can. It comes in at the right length. Fun all round."

Obviously wasn't play tested that well and some aspects of the game are just totally ridiculous. For instance, (1) unlimited searching per room. You can just sit in a room and keep searching until you get the best weapons; (2) the noise tokens add needless complexity and we stopped using them after a few turns; (3) you start off the game with a wimpy weapon and can't do anything and then in a couple turns you are wielding the shotgun or chainsaw and killing 10 zombies a turn.

I like it too, it _is_ fun.  

The scaling of difficulity vs. players seems odd though. If you for example are Three player you get to Control 6 suvivors, but if you are 4 you only get 4 suvivors in total. Also the scenarios is rated on both difficulity grade (easy - medium - hard) and comes with recomondation on how many suvivors there should be. If a scenario is medium for, say, 4 suvivors, than it might in reality be ""easy"" if you are 6 (ie., 3 players). (Some scenarios might have been designed so that zombie-spawn zones could have been depended on the number of suvivors)"

The fact that they've made a kickstarter empire on this trash is hilarious and depressing at the same time.

Okay, rant time. This game is NOT thematic. How is rolling a bucket of dice to wipe out zombies thematic? I just went on a killing rampage with a claw hammer (you can kill three zombies in one attack with it! So stupid) while the guy with the fire axe tries to kill one per swing. Themetacular! You can keep searching the same room the entire game and keep finding shit in it. This turn I found water. This turn I found a chainsaw. This turn I found a submachine gun (?!). What the fuck is thematic about being a goth teen dual-wielding smgs that she found in someone's study after searching REALLY REALLY HARD for three days?

It feels a bit like flashpoint: fire rescue in weight and play. I like this game a bit better though. Flashpoint is an 7 for me and this is an 8.

People have done a lot of great custom content for the game as well. I feel like I'm playing left4dead the board game.

edit:
Like flashpoint I do wonder about the longevity of this game as it's difficult to win mainly due to the largely uncontrollable luck factor. Exceptional team work may not even win you the game half the time. Out of 5 plays we won once by only one surviving player, and the remainder sacrificing themselves to ensure that players success. 

Still a fun game though for now.

There are no real meaningful decisions because usually the board starts filling up with zombies and they force you to take a certain path if you want to survive. You very rarely get the chance to upgrade your character's skills because you will most likely win before then. The minis and components are excellent but I feel like the game is too easy and that there's always an obvious choice. 

The game is an excellent gateway though. New people always love it and it's simple enough for them to understand. It gives the illusion of choice for people who aren't experienced. I don't particularly want to play again but I know I will have to. My game group doesn't seem to want to play anything else :("

Sounds bad? Wrong, it's GOOD. We had bad luck and if you have bad luck in this game, bad things happen to you. And that's exactly as it should be. If it was a walk in the park, where would be the fun in that? Dying isn't bad, being immortal is.

As a personal rule of thumb I strongly dislike almost all Ameritrash type games. Of course there is always an exception to the rule and Zombicide is definitely one of those exceptions. I really enjoy Zombicide for what it is.

My major critique for this game is that the Search action seems to be really powerful since you are basically guaranteed to find something useful every time you search.

1765,Quasimodo77,7,"Un juego sencillo pero muy entretenido, a mi me mola más el inicio que el final con miles de zombies. Aunque pueda no parecerlo me parece muy táctico"
1766,quasipedia,7.4,"Very well themed, it almost plays like RPG, with players naturally describing what the party of survivors is doing, adding gore details and sound effects.  It is also quite simple to explain, and the flat co-operative nature of the game allows new players to jump into the action quickly, being fed the details they need along the game.

The game is designed to be hacked, and in my club we have tons of house rules, for example.

Because of the full co-op mechanics, one possible drawback is that it is very easy to inadvertently exclude somebody from the action, if the group of players is not attentive to include everybody into the discussion/decision making at each turn."
1767,Quayde,5.5,"Mechanically decent coop, which like many both suffers and benefits from an Alpha player. Manages to look like the situation is hopeless, then the team rallies and turns it round. However, just doesn't 'do it' for me... I couldn't care less about the characters or the zombies."

Some examples: 

if you shoot a ranged weapon into a tile with a human player you will hit them every time -- regardless of the number of zombies in that tile. 

If zombies have two equal paths to travel they will split into two and travel both ways. 

I found myself saying ""I don't want to move to space A because the zombies will split, I'll run out of miniatures sooner, and the zombies will get extra activations"". It works for balance, but it kinda kills the theme for me. "
1799,RawToad,N/A,Tim / Warren
1800,raygun gothic,1,"Garbage.  A game based solely on exclusivity and catering to KS backers.  Worries more about collectability than anything else.  Silly, bad gameplay. Lame celebrity knock-off characters. Campy.  Boring. "
1801,rayr,8,"I'm going to put this right at the top. The two most important things to know about this game:
* The only rule is to have fun. Every other rule can be tweaked. It's a sandbox, but unlike some sandbox games, it starts out with a really great set of rules and lets you tweak from there.
* You don't need any of the kickstarter exclusives. They really don't add anything to the game. The exclusive minis have no game changing features and the exclusive survivor dashboards can be printed out or you'll find even more interesting ways to make up your own survivors. You don't need it. If you're like me and you feel a strong compulsion for completionism, it might interest you to know that by the time I'd played my 2nd game of Zombicide, I had learned enough about the game to no longer have any interest in the exclusives.

Pros:
* Fun, tense, exciting. It's really a blast to play this game. It starts out slow, but just a few turns in you're going to start feeling like there's no chance you'll survive.
* Very very flexible. It's a sandbox game. If you don't like something, toss it out. If you want more of something else, add it. In short, if you don't like the game, it's at least partially your own fault. This is the Mongolian Grill of board games. They've provided the ingredients, now you make what tastes good to you.
* Co-op. That's a plus for us. S3 adds PvP rules if that's your thing.
* Big but simple. The game has presence on the table, but despite dozens upon dozens of pieces in play, you'll rarely find yourself looking back at the rulebook once the game gets going (Exception: survivor skills. The names are ""thematic"" but not very descriptive. What does ""Is that all you've got?"" do? What about ""Born Leader"" or ""Lifesaver""?)

Cons:
* Expensive. Way more expensive than it needs to be because there's more chrome than it needs to have. It's also annoying that you have to buy minis you don't want/need in order to get some of the more interesting spawn decks. Example: I already have quite a collection of Walkers (and S3 will add even more), but I'd love to have the spawn cards from the Walk of the Dead sets. $40+ for 24 cards is kind of excessive. Good News: There are three sets of the cards in multiple languages. The important parts of the cards are language independent so you may be able to find someone to split a set with you.
* The randomness of the equipment draw deck is the weakest part of the game for me. Sometimes you draw the best weapons in the deck on your first two or three searches. Sometimes you come up with nothing but AAAGH cards and crowbars while hordes of unstoppable (for now) fatties converge on you. Interestingly, it's the case where you pull too powerful of weapons too early that really ruins the game; being underpowered is more exciting than being overpowered. I'll reiterate that this is a sandbox game and you can certainly tweak things, I haven't yet some up with a ""solution"" to this ""problem"" yet. Incidentally, we ran a scenario where we both started with an ultrared weapon - one ranged and one melee - and could do no further searches. We compensated by adding more spawn points. Being able to kill zombies quickly means you're going to get to higher levels quickly which means the game gets tougher. And it did. Best scenario we've played yet.
* Lots of parts. Setup, cleanup and even play can take a long time if you're using the original game boxes. This is the only game where I went out of my way to repack everything in Plano boxes.

Neutral:
* A bit too ""collectible"" for my tastes. I don't care about the minis and the Big Bang Theory and other celebrity tie ins. Fortunately (for me) this is one of those rare cases when I was able to overpower my  completionism compulsions and convince myself that the special sculpts and survivor dashboards have no value to me and I could ignore them.
* There are a lot of rules wonks whining about the rule where ranges weapons will always hit survivors first. If you don't like the rule, don't use it! Give everyone the Low Profile skill or use one of the variants to add the ability to Duck. It doesn't matter. We like the rule and we play with it. It gives you an incentive to keep a melee weapon on hand (aside from opening doors). If you're on the fence about getting the game, do yourself a favor and ignore the ratings from people complaining about this rule. It's one of the easiest to house rule out (or maybe, like us, you'll decide you like it).

It doesn't take long to figure out the strategy against each type of zombie and a lot of it comes down to dice rolls, but Zombicide knows how to put the hurt on players when it needs to. The game never feels slow or boring. It's a very tense atmosphere.
What really shines is all of the different scenarios and how easy it is to create your own. The game is clearly open to some great expansion ideas too.

More games have to reveal what I really think of the ""extra activation"" mechanic, if the miniatures for a certain type of zombies run out.

I also think that moving dozens of zombie minis every single turn can be a bit of pain when the core of the game is so basic.

1861,RogueThirteen,6.5,"A game with amazing theme and components that just never seems to be as fun as I hope it will once it's on the table.  

The biggest issues for me:

(A) ""Group-Think""  I love the idea of cooperative games, but a lot of them suffer from this.  I never feel like I'm playing a multi-player game as an autonomous survivor trying to co-exist with a group.  Instead, I feel like it always plays out as a single player game  where the group collectively decides what each hero must do at the start of the turn.  Ironically, probably one of those games that's BETTER for solitaire, if that's your kind of thing.

(B) Mission Balance.  The first mission was a nice ""widow-maker"" that was incredibly hard (perhaps too hard).  Some of the other missions, especially those with cars, just felt way toooooo easy and were a big let down after all the time and effort it takes to set-up and run through a mission.

While future expansions and new missions might address (B), I'm not sure what would have addressed (A) for me, and I ended up selling my Abomination copy [for a ridiculously huge chunk of change, so I can't complain].  Furthermore, since mission difficulty didn't scale with the number of players/survivors, the size of your group and how many survivors each player controls will go a long way to skewing a mission (e.g. 4 vs. 6 survivors)."

1881,Ruud2009,6,"31-05-2014. Rated after 2+ plays. What I think about Zombicide I am not sure. I like many aspects of it, but dislike some others. I'll try to explain regardless.

As probably everyone will know you play a survivor in a zombie-apocalypse trying to survive and achieve some objective. I think I've played it 4-5 times in total and so far I have always lost and most goals were simplistic (get food, get these arms etc and get out..).

The components in this game are fantastic. Nice mini's, great quality boards although they look a little samey. The game itself is a very simple coop, in which each survivor basically take 3 actions and then a card is flipped to spawn monsters at each spawn point. Fun thing, the more experience with killing zombies you get, the more come out. Basically, you'll be overwhelmed relatively quickly by a large amount of zombies when you rush out and start killing.

I am not sure how I feel about the link between theme and mechanics. For example, when you shoot in an area with zombies, you always hit the survivor first. Why? Second, why are the missions lame and samey (get something, get out). Why do monsters get stronger if you get better in killing them? I understand why a game would want to do this, but it seems counter intuitive. "

Dead on theme (pun intended), fast play, great coop, looks even more promising if you add expansions, gorgeous minis you simply itch to paint, not at all repetitive thanks to the scenarios. Notably better than any other zombie game I've played, compares well with them and shines. Handy to bring out as a filler, well worth spending a day campaign playing. Not at all a dice fest - yes, there are dice and you use them, but your tactics are way more important than the outcome of your rolls. I wish I'd been a crowdfunder and had gotten more content, but the awesome box with some of the best inlays I've ever seen is well worth the money spent. You get everything you need to play (with extras), and there's hardly a centimeter of wasted space inside. Extra care has been taken to pack the minis individually, which is awesome if you intend to paint them.

Edit: Had to upgrade my rating. This game sees a lot of play at home, and my SO loves it. When Season 3 is eventually released, and competitive teamplay is introduced, it may go even higher."

1929,scatterbrain73,10,"This is one of the most fun and versatile cooperative games I've ever played. The endless combination of tile and equipment card configurations, open-ended objectives, character/enemy selection, and victory conditions make for infinite replayability.

You can run a complex campaign over multiple sessions involving changing maps with discrete objectives, or just lay out a simple map and see how many zombies you can take out. Depending on the scenario it can be a very difficult game; you won't win every time, and sometimes you need to sacrifice survivors to complete the mission, but I guarantee it's never the same game twice. My friends and I usually end up creating distinct personalities and back stories for our characters, especially for campaigns, turning it into somewhat of an RPG. And if you run out of scenarios, the Zombicide website has a great selection of PDFs available for free download.

It's a bit pricey up front, and with all the tokens and pieces you might want to also invest in a compartment storage box or even foam storage if you plan on painting your minis, but I feel like it's worth it. We've gotten so many hours of fun out of this game and I see no signs of slowing down."

1943,sdougla2,6,"Somewhat unpolished, but still fun. There is some strategy, depending on the scenario, and this is a compelling thematic game. The survivors play differently, and they must work together to complete the missions. Zombicide feels bit like a board game version of the zombie killing element of Zombieland. On the other hand, some of the missions are much harder than others, and at least one should have undergone more play testing. 

I like the way that the game incorporates random and push your luck elements, as the zombies behave in deterministic fashion, which allows detailed planning, but certain zombie spawn cards will give them extra activations or spawn zombies on sewer grates rather than their normal spawn points. You need to leave some room in your plans for those cards to come up, but as more and more zombies spawn, it can be difficult to do. Combined with the press your luck way that the attacks work in practice (should I keep attacking, or should I retreat. Should I give up on that survivor, or should I rush in and try to kill the rest of the zombies, thus risking both of us), there is a good amount of decision making. 

Some people have complained about the targeting priority rules. This rule works well in practice, as it creates tension between melee and ranged weapons. Without this rule, guns would always be better than melee weapons (except the Chainsaw). They could have made guns weaker by requiring ammo, but I enjoy the simpler rule set. It leads to enough decision making. This isn't a simulation game; don't expect it to be."

The miniatures this game is equipped with are fantastic in their detail; it can be intimidating to watch the horde develop, but so much fun to move them across the board. 

The different campaigns and double-sided gaming tile allow for higher replayability and interest, as you progress from a beginner to expert. The price may initially seem inaccessible until you play the game for the first time; this is a game you can play alone or with a group of people, play a different version of it each time, with different outcomes each time. This game is beyond the objective of just killing zombies and reaching the exit, which gives a fuller, more collaborative experience.

The website is an excellent resource for new campaigns created for the game, revised rules (the ones provided in my set were contradictory and have since been updated), and other information. 

I do hope for a character expansion set in the future; while you can create your own characters, I am such a fan of the miniatures provided that I would like them to be consistent."

Zombi hentelés ezerrel. A játék szabályai egyszerűek, karaktereinknek 5 helyes hátizsákja van, amiből kettő a két kezünk. 3 szintet tudunk a játékban lépni, amik különböző pluszokat adnak. 3 alap akciónkkal mozogni, támadni, ajtót nyitni, autót vezetni tudunk. Az egyes megszerezhető fegyverek piktogramjai könnyen érhetőek, a harc nagyon egyszerű, ahogy szinte minden a játékban. Talán a zombik mozgása a kör végén macerás kicsit. Ettől függetlenül kapunk egy egyszerű zombiölős játékot, ami a rengeteg szkenárió miatt bőven sok játékalkalmat ad. Egy kiegészítőt is próbáltunk hozzá és a 6-os pont mindenképpen eggyel több a kiegészítőket használva, ami még nagyobb változatosságot ad a játéknak.

Nem tudok igazán belekötni a játékba, mert az autóból kiszállás nélkül épületajtó nyitás is csak az egyszerűség miatt kerülhetett be a játékba. Talán a hentelés unalmassága volt kicsit zavaró. Illetve mégis van egy dolog, ami zavaró és nem jó, mégpedig, hogy a játék nehézsége nincs megoldva. Minél többen vagyunk annál könnyebb, ugyanis mindig ugyanannyi zombi jön bárhányan is játszanak. 5-en pont ideálisnak éreztem. Kevesebben valószínűleg muszáj egy embernek több karaktert vinnie. Nem volt zavaró a holtidő sem. Ez a játék más szemében akár jóval több pontos is lehetne, nálam most ennyi, illetve kiegészítőkkel 7-es. De teljesen jó játék."

I'm not sure exactly what it is about the game that appeals to many of my normally non-gamer friends, but this game has been kind of like magic when it comes to getting people to the table to play. The production definitely goes a long way to it's appeal, but I think the simplicity the mechanics and how well those simple mechanics suit the theme play a large part in it's success. Also, everyone still seems to just love zombies (despite them being absolutely everywhere in gaming/pop culture lately)."

2030,Smaschge,4,"I am not sure about how to rate this game.

I personally try to rate the gameplay and abstract from the subjective or sentimental impression u usually get. that is the reason why i give a low rating.

Positiv features:
My friend, owning the game is a kickstarter backer (abomination or what it is called, when u bought the biggest pack). I was really impressed by the packaging, the top notch miniatures and the amount of stuff u get. There are so many well design miniatures it the whole bundle he got. Also the Artwork is really nice and gives the game a comic like splatter character. I like this.

On the other hand the map tiles look loveless. Example: Dividing the Areas by using pedestrian crossings is nice, but 1 crossing every 5 meters looks weird. A little bit more deviation like using cracks in the street, using cables or stakes/trees/barricades to mark the areas would have been better. (but still this would be a rating of about 8/9 for the artwork and game content)

Rulebook: This one is horror, but not in a good way. it really is nice in design but bad in reading or structure. moreover the scenarios are not in a well deweloped order (i cant remember if u get a storyline but i dont think so) (Still doesn lower the rating below 8)

Gameplay: This is really hard to explain. Many people like the gameplay and call it intuitive and it really is easy to learn and u get experience in controlling the zombies by your moves step by step. But the concept has alot of flaws that should not appear anymore for years.
Considering the Game a survival Horror/Zombie game with leveling Character i present the flaws i found and some changes i would like to see.
1.) It is survival but u have infinite Ammo for the weapons. I think this is contraproductive for decisionmaking and the flair of the game. it also contradicts realism (in a zombie apocalypse) and makes melee less important.
2.) Noise doesnt really have an effect on zombie spawns, zombie movement and attacks or deciding, which weapon u use. Survivors dont need to be quiet. killing is more important. Based on the rules every survivor counts 1 Noise even if he stand still. doesnt make sense. Zombies move to you even if thex dont see u and u dont shoot. Weapons that make no noise dont profit from this concept. 
Zombies should get extra spawn or movement when u are loud.
2.) Infinite searching in one room. I doesnt make sense that u can find 20 weapons in a toilet. ther should be like dice rolling for a search and a limit of stuff u can find. Also i would like to see, that the posibility to find stuff depends on the room you are in. Kitchen = Food, Bedroom/ weapons,..
3.) U cannot shoot zombies without shooting survivors first, if they are in the same area. stupid. should be more like: The chance to hit is like every roll of 1 is friendly fire (makes sense comparing shootguns or other blast weapons with rifles)
4.) ther is no way to react in the zombie activation. this is too static. you should get some choises to react with shots or escapeing/dodging.
5.) u cannot heal attacks. i think food p.e. could be used to heal, so survivors dont die and have to wathc others play for 2 hours.

Ofc the game lives by its house rules and custom maps and there is plenty of room to create excellent games and scenarios. But the points i present show, that the game testing wasnt sufficient. the official game rules and mechanics shouldnt have so many flaws when sold.

The game often becomes a mere search fest followed by a dice fest.people dont die due to bad decisions but pure bad luck, when zombies get multiple activation. u cant do anything then to save your arse.

I dont like pure coop games that much, but this one is abit dull. I put Gears of War way over this one, becaus eof the reaction possibility, cover and the action and damage system. also it has ammo loss as basic concept.

My ratings is based on high expactations that got diluted by poor game mechanics. Use house rules, i say."

2036,SnakePlissken,8,"I like the tension this game provides. Your character grows but so does the zombies horde. Coordination and planning are the key towards achieving the scenario objectives and the dice rolls keep the tension high, as a serie of bad rolls can turn many well-conceived plans into a disaster. 

The expansions and the ever-increasing number of scenarios available for free on the Guillotine's website grant tons of replayability for all the zombies fans. "
2037,Snappleman,9.7,"Love it, Love it, Love it.  Probably my favorite game.  "
2038,SniperDan84,8,"Components - .7/1 Box is solid, cardboard tokens for most statuses work just fine. Cards are small but usable, character sheets are so-so. Zombies and Player models are nice, but zombies are a pain in the ass to put away (slots in box aren't necessarily intuitive). Every time we say we're going to take a picture, yet never do :/

Fun - .8/1 Runs the risk of Alpha player. Generally a great experience, we try to focus play on keeping everyone alive in addition to completing the objective, which creates more tension.

Replayability - 1/1 Tiles are modular to leave a lot of flexibility. Enough components to create a multitude of scenarios if the original get boring. Ultimately enough randomness to be able to play scenarios multiple times.

Strategic - .8/1 Certainly a fair amount of strategy, between balancing kills between survivors, searching versus continuing on, thinning the heard versus claiming objectives, etc. Does suffer some from good strategies can be completely negated due to unlucky card draws (e.g. runners spawn right next to you, then get extra turn).

Theme - .7/1 Not a perfect zombie experience, but does capture the team against a never-ending horde approach.


Personal Rating - 4/5 I really like this game, and more importantly, my family (primary gaming group) really gets into this. My first real co-op game and it took me some time to dial back the Alpha gamer problem. Since getting that under control, people tend to enjoy themselves a lot."

I liken this a lot to Super Dungeon Explore, it takes the dungeon crawl formula and streamlines it into where the players just mow down waves of zombies.  There are some tactics to consider but the rules system for collecting items, using weapons, spawning enemies, etc. are very simplified.  This makes it a very accessible game but it also doesn't make it the most deep or engaging game.  Still, this is certainly a flavor many people enjoy and it knows what it is and does it well.

Also, the game is gorgeous.  It comes in a giant box full of tons of miniatures, all of which are beautifully sculpted.  Plus one of the characters is drive-in diner girl wearing a skirt and skates and wielding a chainsaw.  How do you not just love that?"

Not easy to win (good), cooperation, zombies (very good) and many scenarios and a changing game board (good again) guarantee fun for the genre fan. Where it lacked was in the repetitiveness of the possible actions (search, move and fight). Some surprises, maybe more unique character abilities, something like action cards or alike would have spiced things up. Another thing I didn't like was how most characters seem to die rather anticlimactic: when the zombies attack twice as instructed and you are in the wrong spot, you just die, no defense whatsoever. I don't mind tough games and sacrifices in coop games but this was lame. It can be a long game; the sort of hectic atmosphere fits nicely though, yep, even with complains I am willing to go back and slaughter more zombies!"

The game is a fun zombie co-op which is somewhat reminiscent of the Left 4 Dead video game.  Lots of zombies, some souped up zombies and then the big Abomination to make things really tense.

One of the things I love most about this version (and is the reason I will not buy into Black Plague) is that there is so much fan created content for new ""heroes"" to take through the zombie infested streets including comic characters such as Joker, Nuinja Turtles, etc.  Too much fun!"

Production is superb, rules are simple enough to avoid a headache but complex enough to allow for thematic touches (e.g. noise) and real differentiation between characters.

If the time investment is too much for the level of luck involved, well, it's still an enormously playable example of ""ameritrash"" done right, with genuinely thematic mechanisms, great humour, opportunities for truly awesome or hilariously disastrous dice rolls, and, of course, buckets of plastic."

The only things that keep this game from getting a 10 in my book are:

- The difficulty as you progress could use the slightest tweaking to be not quite as hard. Granted, I love that the S starts to hit the fan as you get further into the game, but it starts to get a little overboard and becomes darn near impossible to win. I think the difficulty could be tweaked to be just a teeny bit easier.

- It is also a little repetitive in that, for the most part, you are pretty much always doing the same thing. Other games I have played have different scenarios that can change very much so what you have to do. Granted, there is of course still the same basic gameplay behind it, but it still gives each scenario a different feel. Here, for the most part it is always just kill zombies and pick up the littel X's. There is nothing wrong with that, but a little variety could give it that extra kick."

2096,Stevemould,6,"See my review!

 Brilliant co-op game. And it is a true co-op game. if you want to survive you'll need to agree a joint course of action and bring the group along with you. no lone wolfing it here. unlike other zombie games, you won't want to be charging into groups of enemies waving a chainsaw round your head. this is all about crowd control, keeping the numbers down, moving the zombies already on the board where you want them to go and keeping one step ahead of the extra turn cards. 

 I'm docking it a point for the rulebook. which is bad. and for scenario 02 which doesn't work, even the revised version.

**********

 edit: After a few more plays, i'm cooler on the game. it's still good fun with some great moments (Amy single handedly holding off the entire zombie horde with chainsaw until we were suddenly able to simply stroll to the exit), but it can be anticlimactic, with either every hero dying in 1 turn due to unlucky card drawing or the survivors simply strolling through, barely having to fire a shot in anger.
 The good thing is that we have the play time right down now and can now play 3 or 4 games in a single evening. It's still an eight, but i can see it slipping over the next few months.

2099,Stexe,6.25,"Light weight zombie survival game, just a little too light weight for my tastes. The rules are really weird and there's ton of ""logic gaps"" and problems with it. The scenarios feel pretty samey -- run away and get some good items then run back and kill stuff. It is basically a glorified dice fest, and it isn't that bad, but it isn't good either. Balancing the kills and special abilities is the most interesting part of the game, but that isn't enough to stand on its own.

The designers have listened to fans and created a good FAQ and have released a lot of scenarios (most fan made) on their website.  

I can understand why some gamers don't like the targeting rule or the splitting rule.  I think they are key to the game play and I play with the rules as is.

We finally completed all of the missions that come in the box.  We will tackle the zombies in Toxic City Mall next.

2109,StormKnight,5,"Visually nice zombie shoot-em-up game. Gives a good feel of exploration and powering up.
Game starts off fast paced, but really starts to drag as more zombies enter the game. Many of these will be on the other side of the board and have almost no effect on the game, except to reduce the zombie pool (running out of models is bad).
Plagued with numerous thematically stupid rules. Worse, much of the decisions in the game are about figuring out how to work around the thematic stupidity.
In a 2 player game, you use 6 characters each. A lot to keep track of, and it means you use ALL the characters in each game, which really reduces the feeling of variety.
Apparently major flaws in existing scenarios and extensive errata on the publisher's website.
Someone at CMON doesn't understand numbering. The tiles have random and incomprehensible numbering schemes, and scenario 10 is the best one for beginners while scenario 1 is the biggest, longest and hardest scenario.

House rule: Just pick character turn order. Clockwise is a royal pain.

For a 6 Survivor Game or a 4 Survivor game on a 2x2 board
Divide the Zombie deck into two piles; the first pile with 16 cards and the second pile with the remainder of the deck.

Draw zombie cards from the small pile first. Zombie draws from this pile are at Blue threat level.

When this pile is exhausted, switch to using the second, larger, deck. Zombie draws from this pile are at the Yellow threat level.

When this pile is exhausted, reshuffle the entire zombie deck and use the full deck. This next pass through, the zombie draws are at the Orange threat level.

Should you exhaust the deck again, reshuffle. All remaining draws are at the Red threat level.

For a 4 Survivor game on a 3x3 board
Don't split the deck.
The first pass through the whole deck is at Blue.
Second pass at Yellow.
Third pass at Orange.
After that as Red.

This does not match the advancement nearly as closely, but with only 4 survivors on a big board you need the help.

Resilient Survivors for 4 Survivor Games
Survivors can take one extra wound. The first wound they take does not cause them to drop an item. To avoid running out of wound cards, simply place the first wound card on the character portrait on the card, then move it into a normal equipment slot when they take their second wound.

Other Stray Variants
No Zombie Amoebas: We simply roll for which direction odd zombies go, rather than having them split.

Tripping over themselves: Zombies moving via an extra activation card have a burst of speed, but tend to moving so hastily they trip stumble over each other in their haste to find tasty flesh. A survivor can never take more than one wound past toughness during a single extra activation card.
However, you can't simply pile up attacks on a character to waste them; the zombies will try to attack all the survivors in a space if possible.
Example 1: Ned and Wanda are in a space together and 5 zombies activate and attack them. They only take 1 wound each.

Example 2: A Tough survivor is attacked by 3 zombies. The survivor still takes 1 wound.

Example 3: A survivor with Tough and a survivor without it are attacked by 2 zombies. The survivor with Tough could ignore the first hit and take a wound on the second, leaving the other survivor unhurt. Or the other survivor could take the hit and the Tough survivor could ignore one hit, leaving the Tough survivor unhurt.

Note that this ONLY applies to bonus activations. If you just start the zombie turn with multiple zombies, you are devoured as normal!

The We didn't buy tons of extra zombie minis Variant: If there aren't enough zombies left to spawn new zombies, activate one zombie of the correct type for each model you are unable to spawn, rather than all the zombies of that type. You may choose which zombies are activated.

Aiming Carefully: You may spend 1 action to aim into a space with other survivors. Your very next shooting attack (including with dual weapons) ignores survivors. However, if you roll 2 or more misses on the attack (counting both weapons if you are using dual weapons), a random survivor takes 1 damage.

We don't actually bother with this variant, as the targeting rules don't really bother us, but it works out as a good simple rule to use."

It was entirely lacking in tension.

Apparently the group had played 2 scenarios earlier in the day and both of those fell flat too. That's a pretty lousy hit rate and poor game design that that can happen as frequently as it seems to here.

Then there are all the crazy-awesome unique characters you can design yourself. Want to tackle the zombie apocalypse as The X-Men? Customize your team and get busy. Want to do it as SG-1? No problem, easy enough to make those characters, too. Thinking that maybe magic is a better route? Craft your Once Upon a Time characters and get busy! Hmm... I might need to do all of these....

It's a basic task-completion to escape-route style game but on a much larger scale than the Forbidden Island type game. The complexity of character and NPC abilities also gives this more weight as an adventure scenario game. Then there are different weapons you can acquire to give you different skills. The options for character development are almost endless. You pick scenarios from the book, but there are an almost infinite number of fan-crafted scenarios online, so every game is guaranteed to be unique and replay is insanely high. This game is definitely better with more than two people, but can also be played solo. that means it's great for the individual gamer who works funky shifts and can't always get a group together, or someone prefers to just not be around other people that much."

It is 2+ hours of repetition without an interesting story arc.

Like many of these level-up games players are rewarded for building up abilities (or at least not deterred from doing so). This causes the game to play much longer than the play warrants. 

If one could get keep it to 30-45 minutes I would be much more interested.

At least the rules overhead is kept fairly low and much of the play is intuitive so it I should easy to get it up and running.

The components are also quite nice.

I like a lot of zombie-themed games. In the category of zombie-fighting-simulator games, I think Dead of Night is better with its cinematic quality and interesting story. Zombie Plague is a better zombie sim because the play is peppier and, again, tells a better story. It'a shame those games are Print-and-Play only.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1.5

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better)- 5

2214,TheKillShirt,8,Check out my video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TQjNTQ1Cvs
2215,theledger,2,"Whether this release was one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetuated on the gaming universe,  or,   at long last,  the definitive zombie infested bliss -  is certainly one that is up for debate.  Undoubtedly,  you will know which soap box it is that I stand upon,  in very short order.

""There's a sucker born every minute"" is a phrase that is often attributed to the late American showman,  P.T. Barnum - although,  in actuality,  it is a phrase believed to have been spoken by someone else,   in criticism of the gullibility of his customers.  In either case,  Zombicide sets out to prove that there is validity in that statement's content.

This game was drummed up more than John Bonham's Ludwig's.  

At a time in my life when my debtors would have been hard pressed to garnish my salary with even a sprig of parsley,  I was hypnotized into dropping a bundle on Zombicide,  despite the gnawing feeling that this was merely chrome in search of a game.

There is no x-ray vision required here.....this purveyor of revulsion is tantamount to a glass bottomed boat.  It won't be long before you see through the thin veneer of shellac that inefficiently canvasses the decadence beneath it. 

Fittingly,  one of the pledge options on Kickstarter sported the moniker ""Abomination Level"".

Henceforth.  I will pay heed to the abundance of telltale signs,  should they surround me again,  in a cacophony of premonitory lamentations. "

2258,ToastToastsToast,9,"Our gaming group was looking for a new co-op challenge, having seemingly exhausted ""Arkham Horror."" ""Zombiecide"" brought in a great challenge. The game also takes the zombie fun from ""Zombies!!!"" and leaves the malevolence behind - you actually get to have fun!

The tutorial is perfect, but a bit misleading - things get much harder after that. 

Playing with more than four players adds an interesting dynamic in that each player only has one survivor. This makes the NECESSARY sacrifice plays much harder to make. Also - like any proper apocalypse - things can go pear-shaped in a hurry, so sound strategy will take numerous plays to develop.

It's rare to have this much fun losing a game. It makes victory all the more glorious.

Special mention is necessary for the quality of the game: Miniatures are the best you will see in a board game less than $100. Map tiles are beautiful/grisly. Cards are great.

Thank you, CMON."
2259,tobias_sweden,5,I had hopes for this game but it fell flat. Three games played today. We won all of them. The hard scenarios wasn't so hard and the medium was way to easy.

2262,tofof,3,"This game's only success is the beautiful miniatures.  
The rulebook is, simply put, a disaster.  Instead of being more tense as more zombies come out, it gets more tedious.  Playtimes are out of whack; for the quoted ""1 hour"" you can have scenarios that take more then 4 hours or less then 35 minutes.  Character balance is nonexistent.  Weird victory conditions make it possible to play for hours, then draw a single rare 'extra activation' card and instantly lose the game when a single survivor dies.  Summed up?  It's just not fun.

2265,tolendante,8,"The true joy of Ameritrash gaming is in the narratives created while playing the game.  Zombicide excels at creating and telling those stories.  The rules need a serious re-write for clarity and I'm not the biggest fan of the way ranged combat works (though it isn't as bad as I had thought it would be before I actually played the game). Other than that rule and some unclear incongraphy, the game is just what I hoped it would be--a fun, dice-throwing romp. The number of missions, free mission design tools, and sandbox nature of the components, means the game should have a long life and remain the darling of house-rulers for years to come."

Cons: If you hate games that are very luck based, may not be for you. Some of the character expansions do feel a bit over saturated for a board game, feels more like DLC from video games.

La variedad de misiones hace que el juego sea muy rejugable. Lo más satisfactorio del juego es encontrarse en situaciones de las que parece que es imposible librarse y ver cómo al final consigues salir del problema. Los puntos negativos pueden ser que hay misiones que no están muy bien equilibradas y que a veces lo de las activaciones no tienen mucho sentido no pudiendo hacer nada en ocasiones para librarte de la muerte.

2278,Torquin,7,"Zombicide is a game that does not live up to its promise as far as the written rules go. The theme, artwork and quality of components really deserve some rule tweaking. On thing that really has to go is the make-an-additional-turn-with-one-of-the-zombie-types spawn card. This card makes any sort of planning or calculated risk-taking impossible and therefore discourages creative tactics. The first full scenario is hard enough without it! Another rule that has to go is the one regarding the placement of an extra zombie whenever a group of them cannot be split evenly between direction. However, with some house rules I feel like Zombicide is a fun, atmospheric and easy to explain boardgame. I am really considering purchasing it, even though its retail price is intimidating."

It is a zombie apocalypse after all - everyone pretty much expects to die.  I would rate it higher if the playing time didn't drag out - it often ends up being too long for what it is.

This should perhaps be a 2 but it's so inoffensive and bland I'm not sure it qualifies.

Several mechanics just fundamentally don't make sense for the theme - most obviously zombies splitting in half or speeding up for no reason. The game has no sense of pacing at all, as though the creators had never actually watched a zombie film but created a game having merely heard about them. Objectives are boring ""randomly search for cans"" nonsense and players are actively encouraged to micromanage who kills what instead of being free to do the only remotely fun thing in the game - rolling dice to shoot zombies.

Even if all that were fixed this would be no more than an average dice rolling time waster."

Zombies in Zombicide are extremely weak, but there's a ton of them, as apposed to LNOE where there's relatively few zombies but they are extremely hard to kill.

- characters may die fast because of bad luck in dice rolls or zombie spawns
- Gets off-balance fast if you add more editions to the spawn deck. CMoN didn't take any effort to balance the additional content. Mixing the base box with prison outbreak works decently though.

this was when the ""KS Exclusive"" concept was relatively new,

2428,WKDFROG,7,"Review Date: May 2017

Positives: Simple to learn. Great Co-op Game for those who like minis and killing a lot of zombies! Beautiful production of models, some other components could (and did) improve with Black Plague edition (player boards). 


Negatives: Can lead to alpha gamer syndrome if not playing solo. Some rules make no real sense (shooting other players for one). Can become surprisingly mathy for such an ameritrash game. You either win with no challenge or get completely annihilated, very little middle room which is where the flavour is. Horrendously long setup and take down time

2429,wkover,6,"The single biggest flaw in the original Zombies!!! is that it wasn't cooperative.  So Zombicide at least gets that part right.

Zombicide, overall, is at least OK.  I would play again, which is more than I can say for most of its zombie brethren: the countless Walking Dead games, All Things Zombie, etc.  There's light decision-making, endless searching, and more die-rolling than you can shake an apocalypse at.

Flaws do exist in the game, and if these were to show themselves repeatedly I'd be sure to quit the game forever.  I've gotten lucky so far, though, and the flaws have pretty much kept to themselves.  Just shy, I guess."

- mechanic ในการ spawn zombie ทำให้ต้องคิดมากขึ้น

การคิดในการเล่น
บางที theme ของเกมอาจะทำให้คิดว่าเป็น action ลุยๆเพียงเดียว แต่จริงๆแล้วเกมนี้การเดินแต่ละตาต้องคิดละเอียดมากทีเดียว (ในฉาก hard) ความสนุกของเกมนี้ขึ้นอยู่กับฉากที่เลือกมาเล่นสูง 
- บริหารจัดการ action ของตัวผู้เล่นและอาวุธที่มีในมือ ลำดับความสำคัญก่อนหลัง คิดล่วงหน้า action ของแต่ละตัว
- คำนวณความน่าจะเป็น เกมนี้เหมือนใช้ดวงในการทอยเต๋า แต่จริงๆแล้วต้องคำนวณความน่าจะเป็นอยู่ว่า action combat ที่เราจะทำมีประโยชน์หรือไม่ หรือควรตัดสินใจทำอย่างอื่นดี
- แผนสำรอง, ปิดความเสี่ยง ความท้าทายของเกมนี้ตรงที่มีความไม่แน่นอนสูงมากกว่าเกมทั่วไป คือการ spawn zombie ซึ่งอาจทำให้สถานการณ์จากดีเป็นแย่สุดๆได้ ต้องใช้วิธีการจัดการความเสี่ยงและการเผื่อทางหนีทีไล่ไว้ในการเอาชนะเกม

The zombie mechanics work pretty well: walkers are an annoyance, fatties are scary, and runners are terrifying. Haven't dealt with an abomination yet. The minis are obviously excellent and the tiles look great too. I have a quibble with the building spawn rules but everything else seems fine.

2484,Yokiboy,10,"[b]Initial comment while waiting for the game:[/b]
I'm incredibly excited about this game! It seems to be the zombie board game I've been looking for, something in the genre of the Dead Nation PS3 game. It's also seems close (in design goals) to the zombie game I've been designing on my own.

[b]Comments upon unpacking my two Abomination sets:[/b]
Holy cow! First, I have never seen a couple of games better packaged to not get banged up, scuffed or dented in transit. Kudos to Cool Mini or Not!

Second, I have never seen a game's components so well packaged to avoid anything breaking in transit from manufacturer to end consumer. This game eclipses even Days of Wonders and GameWorks titles in how well tightly everything was packed. I'm in awe!

Third, this game looks better than most other games I own. Great looking rule book with lots of well illustrated examples, and people must be a whole lot more sensitive to me, but I find the rules well written (barring a few translation snafus). The game comes with wonderful looking and greatly functional character sheets, high quality minis that should paint up very well, good dice, nice snappy cards, and thick cardboard boards and tokens.

[b]Comments after initial play:[/b]
The gameplay is very intuitive and reminiscent of a good coop shooter video game. This will likely become a huge favorite of mine.

Lastly, I love toolbox games such as this. I think it stems from my RPG background, but I love making my own scenarios, coming up with house rules, and other additions.

I highly recommend this game!

[b]Comments after being beaten down in scenario 01 twice:[/b]
This game's fun! I feel like I'm at the edge of my seat. I love how in the solitaire version you can choose the activation order of your characters, and wish this was featured in the multi-player game as well.

I love facing hordes of zombies. This game has become an instant favorite, and should get to the table frequently. My 13 year old daughter also enjoyed her first play.

[b]Comments After 8 Plays:[/b]
If I don't count Scenario 00, Tutorial, then I have won only one game in 7 tries. I've lost Scenario 01, City Blocks, 4 times, while I've lost twice and won once in Scenario 10, Small Town. I still cannot stop playing. After my first win, I thought I had found a working strategy, but pulling one of the 4 Extra Turn cards can really change all that in a hurry.

The complete randomness of those Extra Turn cards, and the Sewer cards to a lesser extent, is starting to bother me a bit. There are 4 Extra Turn cards, and 2 Sewer cards, in a deck of only 42 cards, and in all but Scenario 07, Grindhouse, and Scenario 09, Might Makes Right there are 4 Spawning Zones, meaning at least 4 cards are drawn per round in the game. You go through the deck in 10.5 rounds, if you don't break into any unopened Buildings. This means you will frequently see Extra Turns and Sewer cards that foil otherwise perfect plans.

Obviously the game needs this to an extent, I just feel like I have no control over it at all. Sure, I try to avoid standing in zones with sewers, I also to keep zombies at least two zones away, but that's not enough when it comes to the Runners.

Enough whining, and back to the game. :zombie:

[b]Comments After 16 Plays:[/b]
Once you get to know the tactics of the game, you can mitigate the luck of the draw some, you also must keep track of cards already discarded versus still in the Zombie deck.

I have upped my rating to 10, given that I have rarely had such an urge to just play the game around the clock. This game is pure fun to me. It is exactly the zombie toolbox that I wanted. Coming up with new characters, and scenarios is dirt simple, and very rewarding. I love Zombicide!

But I have played co-op games where it's not possible for one player to dominate the game, so maybe it's just the way this game works. I mean, if there is only one ""optimal"" play, it's obviously going to get pointed out. There really weren't many situations where a decision had to be made - it was more of just following a path: do this, that unlocks that, go there, do something else, etc. Not really anything else to do, which is also why I give it a low score."

2520,zombiegod,3.8,"YAY! A box of overpriced miniatures to keep the fanboys and painting crowd happy for months.

Get over this and you'll find that mechanically it's as shallow as they come. The inclusion of a heap of mini's seems to exclude the need for any form of depth.

Tediously dull, boring, and drawn out to the max. With basic, outdated mechanics and little to no agonizing choices.

2528,Zyrallus,3.8,"So much potential here. Seriously, with a less punishing (although interesting) leveling mechanism and some form of barricading/defensive options, this would be a go-to game. As it stands, it's fun without being overly impressive. And it's somewhat annoying to witness potential like this fall short of greatness.

Edit 1/3/12:
Played about four or five more times and am putting the game away for good. Way too many problems. Lowering rating substantially. Good intentions, but poor, awful, terrible, blah execution. Shame."
2529,zyx0xyz,7.6,"唯一的亮点就是模型和版图美工了，但本人作为一个十多年的生化危机fans，体验zombicide后，实在没有发现更多出彩的地方了，耐玩度主要体现在人物搭配及不同剧本的完成难度上。。。售价也不便宜，现在一个一个扩也接踵而至，价格嘛，你懂的。。。

2532,_The_Inquiry_,4,"Prior to 2020: 1 play

If there's a single game I'd point to that represents what an ""Ameritrash"" game is, I'd point to this one.  This is not because Zombicide is the best this school of design has to offer, far from it in my opinion, but because it embodies so many of the features that crafted this design philosophy - theme that spills everywhere from the components to the rules limitations, over-produced components (large quantities of components, in general, especially given the kickstarter model that this used so well to generate hype) and miniatures, plenty of chaotic dice-rolling accompanied by tactical reacting, and a game that embraces making one's way through chaotic circumstances.  This game is certainly one that feels ""epic"" in scale, although its design, in my opinion, falls far short of the table presence engendered by the lavish production.  While there's some interesting decisions to be made regarding tactical positioning relative to the hordes of zombies and objectives, the combat, turn structure, and rules fail to augment these decisions, often leading to a game that feels much less than the sum of its parts.  Rules such as those that require you target allies before zombies when using ranged weapons to attack a tile with both further detract from the decision-making and tactical positioning, and they end up leaving players without as many viable options.  This leads to a game that feels uninteresting and trivial.  Couple this with the fact that so much of the early game devolves into searching like mad to find weapons randomly in hopes of getting something slightly more viable, and you have a recipe for boredom.  A light beer-and-pretzels game this could be, but the scope and length of the design keep it dragging much longer than it can hold interest, leading to an exhausting slog to the finish.  Definite disappointment for what could've been so much more interesting had the design been given depth in the areas that mattered, rather than complexity and fiddliness in the areas that did not."
